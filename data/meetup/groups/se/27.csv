This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

<p><span>Want to learn photography from the beginning!</span></p>
<p>Fed-up shooting in Auto Mode, want to shoot Manual...</p>
<p>Want to meet other photographers!</p>
<p>Want to understand how your camera works!</p>
<p>Want to go on some Photo shoots</p>
<p><span>Need inspiration</span></p>
<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>

<p><span>Want to learn photography from the beginning!</span></p>
<p>Fed-up shooting in Auto Mode, want to shoot Manual...</p>
<p>Want to meet other photographers!</p>
<p>Want to understand how your camera works!</p>
<p>Want to go on some Photo shoots</p>
<p><span>Need inspiration</span></p>
<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>

Of course, as the name indicates the focus of this group will be to include mälaren one way or another in all photos. You can go to the same place over and over again, and always walk away with widely different images depending on angles, time of day and weather. This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p> 
<p>As a supplement to this page there is also a Stockholm Water Photography group on Facebook to share pics and discussions (with the same name). It's a closed group only for members of SWP on meetup. To join, send a request on FB and we will get you into the group asap.

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups.

<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

This Meetup group will be in English to accommodate a maximum of non Swedish-speaking people. Activities will greatly depend on the group dynamics, so join us for some fun photo learning and sharing time!</p>

Of course, as the name indicates the focus of this group will be to include mälaren one way or another in all photos. You can go to the same place over and over again, and always walk away with widely different images depending on angles, time of day and weather. This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>

<p><span>Want to learn photography from the beginning!</span></p>
<p>Fed-up shooting in Auto Mode, want to shoot Manual...</p>
<p>Want to meet other photographers!</p>
<p>Want to understand how your camera works!</p>
<p>Want to go on some Photo shoots</p>
<p><span>Need inspiration</span></p>
<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>

<p><span>Want to learn photography from the beginning!</span></p>
<p>Fed-up shooting in Auto Mode, want to shoot Manual...</p>
<p>Want to meet other photographers!</p>
<p>Want to understand how your camera works!</p>
<p>Want to go on some Photo shoots</p>
<p><span>Need inspiration</span></p>
<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>

You can go to the same place over and over again, and always walk away with widely different images depending on angles, time of day and weather. This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p> 
<p>As a supplement to this page there is also a Stockholm Water Photography group on Facebook to share pics and discussions (with the same name). It's a closed group only for members of SWP on meetup. To join, send a request on FB and we will get you into the group asap. If you use a different (or just one) name on meetup as compared to facebook pls send us an email so we know who you are.</p>",,,,,,,18822214,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Water-Photography/,18.06999969482422,1119,Stockholm Water Photography,191123920.0,Justin,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/b/a/highres_248686266.jpeg,248686266.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/b/a/member_248686266.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/b/a/thumb_248686266.jpeg,member,4.73,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'hiking', 'name': 'Hiking', 'id': 638}, {'urlkey': 'walkers', 'name': 'Walking', 'id': 933}, {'urlkey': 'expat', 'name': 'Expat', 'id': 4446}, {'urlkey': 'photojournalism', 'name': 'Photojournalism', 'id': 9298}, {'urlkey': 'outdoors', 'name': 'Outdoors', 'id': 15046}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}]",Stockholm-Water-Photography,3600000,public,Photographers

The aim of this group will be to meet and share our photography knowledge, learn from other people's work and their approach to photography, and go take pictures together. Any skills levels are welcome, and owning a fancy camera is not required (a simple camera phone will do!). This Meetup group will be in English to accommodate a maximum of non Swedish-speaking people. Activities will greatly depend on the group dynamics, so join us for some fun photo learning and sharing time!</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

Of course, as the name indicates the focus of this group will be to include mälaren one way or another in all photos. You can go to the same place over and over again, and always walk away with widely different images depending on angles, time of day and weather. This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p> 
<p>As a supplement to this page there is also a Stockholm Water Photography group on Facebook to share pics and discussions (with the same name). It's a closed group only for members of SWP on meetup. To join, send a request on FB and we will get you into the group asap.

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

Of course, as the name indicates the focus of this group will be to include mälaren one way or another in all photos. You can go to the same place over and over again, and always walk away with widely different images depending on angles, time of day and weather. This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p>

The aim of this group will be to meet and share our photography knowledge, learn from other people's work and their approach to photography, and go take pictures together. Any skills levels are welcome, and owning a fancy camera is not required (a simple camera phone will do!). This Meetup group will be in English to accommodate a maximum of non Swedish-speaking people. Activities will greatly depend on the group dynamics, so join us for some fun photo learning and sharing time!</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>

27,photography,photography,Uppsala,SE,1464210061000,"<p>The Uppsala Photography Meetup Group is for anybody interested in photography and willing to meet fellow photo enthusiasts in and around Uppsala. The aim of this group will be to meet and share our photography knowledge, learn from other people's work and their approach to photography, and go take pictures together. Any skills levels are welcome, and owning a fancy camera is not required (a simple camera phone will do!). This Meetup group will be in English to accommodate a maximum of non Swedish-speaking people. Activities will greatly depend on the group dynamics, so join us for some fun photo learning and sharing time!</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/highres_462136103.jpeg,462136103.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/600_462136103.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/e/7/thumb_462136103.jpeg,event,24437460,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Naturfoto/,18.06999969482422,436,Stockholm Nature Photography,192565336.0,Ewi,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/highres_275532707.jpeg,275532707.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/member_275532707.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/1/a/3/thumb_275532707.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'digcam', 'name': 'Digital Photography', 'id': 206}, {'urlkey': 'photo', 'name': 'Photography', 'id': 223}, {'urlkey': 'nature-photography', 'name': 'Nature Photography', 'id': 16600}, {'urlkey': 'landscape-photography', 'name': 'Landscape Photography', 'id': 22268}, {'urlkey': 'photography-on-location-using-natural-light', 'name': 'Photography on Location-Using Natural Light.', 'id': 26111}, {'urlkey': 'videography', 'name': 'Videography', 'id': 27494}, {'urlkey': 'outdoor-photography', 'name': 'Outdoor Photography', 'id': 39879}, {'urlkey': 'photograph-in-the-natural-scene', 'name': 'Photograph in the Natural Scene', 'id': 44279}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography', 'name': 'Analog Photography', 'id': 104763}, {'urlkey': 'early-morning', 'name': 'Early Morning', 'id': 113408}, {'urlkey': 'analog-photography-and-alternative-printing', 'name': 'Analog photography and alternative printing', 'id': 152707}, {'urlkey': 'nature', 'name': 'Nature', 'id': 197471}, {'urlkey': 'nature-videography', 'name': 'Nature Videography', 'id': 548312}, {'urlkey': 'aerial-videography', 'name': 'Aerial videography', 'id': 572972}, {'urlkey': 'sunset-and-sunrise-photography', 'name': 'Sunset and Sunrise Photography', 'id': 1506425}]",Stockholm-Naturfoto,3600000,public_limited,Members

This group aims for likeminded members to hike/explore together to not just find and share the best spots to photograph Stockholm and the archipelago from, but also help to decipher how to best utilize a location. The group is open for anyone interested in photography. It's an advantage to have an SLR but phone cameras work fine also.</p>

27,photography,photography,Stockholm,SE,1497343645000,"<p>Do you need 1 hour to walk 50 meters? You wake up at 4 am and when you see fog outside you just run out with your camera? Well, than this is the right Meet up for you!</p>
<p>This Meetup is for the enthusiastic photographer who is willing to put some extra effort in planning photography. It's not about total control and leaving no space for creativity and surprises. It's about to find favorable conditions of the location considering light, weather, season, gear, clothing, travels and more. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if things don't work out as planned, the group members always made out the best of it. At the end many consider photography also as a reason to go out in nature and just get out there.</p>
<p>Meet other people who capture vast landscape and details of nature, like Grand Landscape and Intimate Landscape, who don't mind to get up early with the sun, adore frosty mornings at -10 degrees with hoar frost or find inspiration even on a rainy and cloudy day. No matter if you work conceptual, intuitive, are on a project/series, photograph only puddles or valleys, with your starter kit or a pinhole: You are welcome to meet up and add your thoughts on the planning in the comment field with your experience!</p>
<p> Your personal engagement is a vital part of this group and it shows in a review after each Meetup and active participation. We have also an account on Instagram where we share photos from our Meetups:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/"">https://www.instagram.com/stockholm_naturephoto/</a></p>
<p>Furthermore we started to meetup for discuss and analyse our photos on a regular base.</p>
<p>Meet new people, explore new locations, learn new things, share your knowledge, your interest and have fun. Genuine interest in photography and strong relation to nature will make some physically exhausting excursion much easier.</p>
<p> This isn't a Meetup to take a snapshot with the phone in a pretty place to share on social media and that's it. In this case an Outdoor or Nature Walk could be more suitable for you ;-) </p>
<p>I hope to create a platform where you get stimulation trough meaningful conversations during our Meetups and can grow in your very own view on photography and skills. I truly believe in dialogue with same minded people and people with all different views than oneself's views, and change of routines as a catalysator for creativity and tool to go beyond limits. If you can imagine it, than you can do it ;-) But many great photos actually are not imagined, but just happen intuitively. In this group we plan the conditions and than let it just happen.. Than it's also of course about just being in nature and enjoy. My camera is practically like a dog that needs to be walked and takes me out to great new places. It's like a friend I am taking a walk with and shows me around and let's me experience my surrounding more careful. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>It is a vital part of the community to read reviews of each Meetup and are part of your participation in our Meetups: to review the Event later on and I hope a lot that you agree on that, merci!</p>
<p>I hope you like the Meet ups, you are welcome to come up with ideas. Since June 2017 this group created 24 Meet ups.

<p><span>Want to learn photography from the beginning!</span></p>
<p>Fed-up shooting in Auto Mode, want to shoot Manual...</p>
<p>Want to meet other photographers!</p>
<p>Want to understand how your camera works!</p>
<p>Want to go on some Photo shoots</p>
<p><span>Need inspiration</span></p>
<p><span>Want to help other people become better photographers</span></p>
<p><span>Of course you can sit down in front of Youtube for hours on end reviewing famous or not so famous Photographers educational videos. There are so many out there they don't even charge any thing... &nbsp;Another way is to pay a local Photographer anything from 600 to 900 SEK for a couple of hours instruction around town. Lets be honest here, your not going to get much out of that. How much can one learn in 3 hours.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Or what you can do is join us! We can tick all the boxes above and we are free. We never charge a cent!</span></p>
<p>TEOP (Teach Each Other Photography) is a group of photographers that enjoy helping each other learn the in's and out's of Photography.</p>
<p>We have regular meet ups were we discuss different techniques of photography, then go out and put them to the test. We have already this year helped a number of photographers take that step from Auto to manual.. free of charge!</p>
<p>We have been on a number of sporting events, Photo walks and night photography shoots around Malmö and Copenhagen. We also have access to a photo studio free of charge.</p>
<p>The great thing about TEOP is that if you are interest in learning something about Photography and your not sure about something. No worries someone else will know it, if not we all help to research it together until we understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody pretends to be an expert here, but we enjoy photography and we take pride in taking nice photographs and we believe that is the important thing.</p>
<p>The group started August 2014 and with in that time many strong friendships have been forged..&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We feel this is a unique concept of learning to become a better photographer....</span></p>
