Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

11,games,games,Göteborg,SE,1484830863000,"<p>You like board games (no matter the form: strategy, coop, cards...)? You wish to meet new people while doing something fun? Perhaps you want to discover new games? Or you're looking for players to try out that brand new game you just bought or to play this old one you love?</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, <b>welcome to the Göteborg Board Games Meetup!</b></p>
<p>The ambition with this group is to meet once every 2 weeks to talk about board games in all their forms and of course to play the games we like! From the classics (monopoly, chess, risk...) to the newest ones, from those that only take 30mn to those that last several hours (though for now Role Playing Games aren't the primary target but we can discuss how to make it happen if anyone is interested)!</p>
<p><i>Note that I would like the language of this group to be English, both online and during our meetings, to ensure people from every horizon can participate (and most games are in English anyway).</i></p>
<p>~~~~~~ <br>I started this meet up because I love board games myself and know it's not always easy to find players or to know which game to buy next. Plus they're a great ice breaker and a good way to make friends!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/highres_457765114.jpeg,457765114.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/600_457765114.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/thumb_457765114.jpeg,event,21987050,open,57.720001220703125,https://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Board-Games/,12.010000228881836,728,Göteborg Board Games Meetup,26313842,David Gay-Perret,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/highres_263461515.jpeg,263461515,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/member_263461515.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/thumb_263461515.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'newintown', 'name': 'New In Town', 'id': 1273}, {'urlkey': 'cardgame', 'name': 'Card Games', 'id': 9792}, {'urlkey': 'games', 'name': 'Games', 'id': 15992}, {'urlkey': 'make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life', 'name': 'Make New Friends', 'id': 17225}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-games', 'name': 'Strategy Games', 'id': 17785}, {'urlkey': 'board-games', 'name': 'Board Games', 'id': 19585}, {'urlkey': 'game-night', 'name': 'Game Night', 'id': 40126}, {'urlkey': 'international-friends', 'name': 'International Friends', 'id': 50881}, {'urlkey': 'classic-board-games', 'name': 'Classic Board Games', 'id': 57787}, {'urlkey': 'party-board-games', 'name': 'Party & Board Games', 'id': 96968}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-board-games', 'name': 'Strategy Board Games', 'id': 169853}]",Goteborg-Board-Games,3600000,public,Board Games Lovers

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Perhaps you want to discover new games? Or you're looking for players to try out that brand new game you just bought or to play this old one you love?</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, <b>welcome to the Göteborg Board Games Meetup!</b></p>
<p>The ambition with this group is to meet once every 2 weeks to talk about board games in all their forms and of course to play the games we like! From the classics (monopoly, chess, risk...) to the newest ones, from those that only take 30mn to those that last several hours (though for now Role Playing Games aren't the primary target but we can discuss how to make it happen if anyone is interested)!</p>
<p><i>Note that I would like the language of this group to be English, both online and during our meetings, to ensure people from every horizon can participate (and most games are in English anyway).</i></p>
<p>~~~~~~ <br>I started this meet up because I love board games myself and know it's not always easy to find players or to know which game to buy next. Plus they're a great ice breaker and a good way to make friends!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/highres_457765114.jpeg,457765114.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/600_457765114.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/thumb_457765114.jpeg,event,21987050,open,57.720001220703125,https://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Board-Games/,12.010000228881836,728,Göteborg Board Games Meetup,26313842,David Gay-Perret,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/highres_263461515.jpeg,263461515,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/member_263461515.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/thumb_263461515.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'newintown', 'name': 'New In Town', 'id': 1273}, {'urlkey': 'cardgame', 'name': 'Card Games', 'id': 9792}, {'urlkey': 'games', 'name': 'Games', 'id': 15992}, {'urlkey': 'make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life', 'name': 'Make New Friends', 'id': 17225}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-games', 'name': 'Strategy Games', 'id': 17785}, {'urlkey': 'board-games', 'name': 'Board Games', 'id': 19585}, {'urlkey': 'game-night', 'name': 'Game Night', 'id': 40126}, {'urlkey': 'international-friends', 'name': 'International Friends', 'id': 50881}, {'urlkey': 'classic-board-games', 'name': 'Classic Board Games', 'id': 57787}, {'urlkey': 'party-board-games', 'name': 'Party & Board Games', 'id': 96968}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-board-games', 'name': 'Strategy Board Games', 'id': 169853}]",Goteborg-Board-Games,3600000,public,Board Games Lovers

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

11,games,games,Stockholm,SE,1471531699000,"<p>Welcome to the Stockholm Roleplaying Guild.&nbsp; <br> <br>We're a group of people who are into tabletop roleplaying games. <br> <br>This meetup group is intended to allow Tabletop RPG gamers of Stockholm to find other people to game with, to join sessions hosted by it's members, and to use this page as a starting point to get your game on in the Stockholm region.&nbsp; <br> <br>Also, we support a number of regular campaigns, running at least one session a month, as well as one-shot adventures. Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Perhaps you want to discover new games? Or you're looking for players to try out that brand new game you just bought or to play this old one you love?</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, <b>welcome to the Göteborg Board Games Meetup!</b></p>
<p>The ambition with this group is to meet once every 2 weeks to talk about board games in all their forms and of course to play the games we like! From the classics (monopoly, chess, risk...) to the newest ones, from those that only take 30mn to those that last several hours (though for now Role Playing Games aren't the primary target but we can discuss how to make it happen if anyone is interested)!</p>
<p><i>Note that I would like the language of this group to be English, both online and during our meetings, to ensure people from every horizon can participate (and most games are in English anyway).</i></p>
<p>~~~~~~ <br>I started this meet up because I love board games myself and know it's not always easy to find players or to know which game to buy next. Plus they're a great ice breaker and a good way to make friends!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/highres_457765114.jpeg,457765114.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/600_457765114.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/thumb_457765114.jpeg,event,21987050,open,57.720001220703125,https://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Board-Games/,12.010000228881836,728,Göteborg Board Games Meetup,26313842,David Gay-Perret,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/highres_263461515.jpeg,263461515,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/member_263461515.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/thumb_263461515.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'newintown', 'name': 'New In Town', 'id': 1273}, {'urlkey': 'cardgame', 'name': 'Card Games', 'id': 9792}, {'urlkey': 'games', 'name': 'Games', 'id': 15992}, {'urlkey': 'make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life', 'name': 'Make New Friends', 'id': 17225}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-games', 'name': 'Strategy Games', 'id': 17785}, {'urlkey': 'board-games', 'name': 'Board Games', 'id': 19585}, {'urlkey': 'game-night', 'name': 'Game Night', 'id': 40126}, {'urlkey': 'international-friends', 'name': 'International Friends', 'id': 50881}, {'urlkey': 'classic-board-games', 'name': 'Classic Board Games', 'id': 57787}, {'urlkey': 'party-board-games', 'name': 'Party & Board Games', 'id': 96968}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-board-games', 'name': 'Strategy Board Games', 'id': 169853}]",Goteborg-Board-Games,3600000,public,Board Games Lovers

11,games,games,Stockholm,SE,1471531699000,"<p>Welcome to the Stockholm Roleplaying Guild.&nbsp; <br> <br>We're a group of people who are into tabletop roleplaying games. <br> <br>This meetup group is intended to allow Tabletop RPG gamers of Stockholm to find other people to game with, to join sessions hosted by it's members, and to use this page as a starting point to get your game on in the Stockholm region.&nbsp; <br> <br>Also, we support a number of regular campaigns, running at least one session a month, as well as one-shot adventures. Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

11,games,games,Göteborg,SE,1484830863000,"<p>You like board games (no matter the form: strategy, coop, cards...)? You wish to meet new people while doing something fun? Perhaps you want to discover new games? Or you're looking for players to try out that brand new game you just bought or to play this old one you love?</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, <b>welcome to the Göteborg Board Games Meetup!</b></p>
<p>The ambition with this group is to meet once every 2 weeks to talk about board games in all their forms and of course to play the games we like! From the classics (monopoly, chess, risk...) to the newest ones, from those that only take 30mn to those that last several hours (though for now Role Playing Games aren't the primary target but we can discuss how to make it happen if anyone is interested)!</p>
<p><i>Note that I would like the language of this group to be English, both online and during our meetings, to ensure people from every horizon can participate (and most games are in English anyway).</i></p>
<p>~~~~~~ <br>I started this meet up because I love board games myself and know it's not always easy to find players or to know which game to buy next. Plus they're a great ice breaker and a good way to make friends!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/highres_457765114.jpeg,457765114.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/600_457765114.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/a/thumb_457765114.jpeg,event,21987050,open,57.720001220703125,https://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Board-Games/,12.010000228881836,728,Göteborg Board Games Meetup,26313842,David Gay-Perret,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/highres_263461515.jpeg,263461515,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/member_263461515.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/b/thumb_263461515.jpeg,member,5.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'newintown', 'name': 'New In Town', 'id': 1273}, {'urlkey': 'cardgame', 'name': 'Card Games', 'id': 9792}, {'urlkey': 'games', 'name': 'Games', 'id': 15992}, {'urlkey': 'make-new-friends-from-all-walks-of-life', 'name': 'Make New Friends', 'id': 17225}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-games', 'name': 'Strategy Games', 'id': 17785}, {'urlkey': 'board-games', 'name': 'Board Games', 'id': 19585}, {'urlkey': 'game-night', 'name': 'Game Night', 'id': 40126}, {'urlkey': 'international-friends', 'name': 'International Friends', 'id': 50881}, {'urlkey': 'classic-board-games', 'name': 'Classic Board Games', 'id': 57787}, {'urlkey': 'party-board-games', 'name': 'Party & Board Games', 'id': 96968}, {'urlkey': 'strategy-board-games', 'name': 'Strategy Board Games', 'id': 169853}]",Goteborg-Board-Games,3600000,public,Board Games Lovers

11,games,games,Stockholm,SE,1471531699000,"<p>Welcome to the Stockholm Roleplaying Guild.&nbsp; <br> <br>We're a group of people who are into tabletop roleplaying games. <br> <br>This meetup group is intended to allow Tabletop RPG gamers of Stockholm to find other people to game with, to join sessions hosted by it's members, and to use this page as a starting point to get your game on in the Stockholm region.&nbsp; <br> <br>Also, we support a number of regular campaigns, running at least one session a month, as well as one-shot adventures. Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

11,games,games,Stockholm,SE,1471531699000,"<p>Welcome to the Stockholm Roleplaying Guild.&nbsp; <br> <br>We're a group of people who are into tabletop roleplaying games. <br> <br>This meetup group is intended to allow Tabletop RPG gamers of Stockholm to find other people to game with, to join sessions hosted by it's members, and to use this page as a starting point to get your game on in the Stockholm region.&nbsp; <br> <br>Also, we support a number of regular campaigns, running at least one session a month, as well as one-shot adventures. Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

11,games,games,Stockholm,SE,1471531699000,"<p>Welcome to the Stockholm Roleplaying Guild.&nbsp; <br> <br>We're a group of people who are into tabletop roleplaying games. <br> <br>This meetup group is intended to allow Tabletop RPG gamers of Stockholm to find other people to game with, to join sessions hosted by it's members, and to use this page as a starting point to get your game on in the Stockholm region.&nbsp; <br> <br>Also, we support a number of regular campaigns, running at least one session a month, as well as one-shot adventures. Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>

Each game supports 3-6 players plus a Games Master. Anyone is welcome to join &amp;/or run a game and coordinate via this site. <br> <br>A roleplaying campaign involves playing a character over many sessions, stretching over months or sometimes even years and would suit players ready to commit to attending most sessions in order to help keep the story going and to be fair to other players. <br> <br>One-shot adventures are suited to play over one or two sessions and are suitable for players interested in trying roleplaying games but who are unwilling or unable to commit to a full campaign. &nbsp;They're also a good way to try out something new or take a break from your regular campaign. <br></p>
<p>We currently run one whole-club meetup a month, usually on the second Saturday of the month, in Älvsjö. The monthly meetups are a time to get everyone together in the same space to run all the games we're currently running, catch up with our fellow gamers, and briefly discuss club business. People are, of course, welcome to run their own games whenever they like and use this Meetup as a resource for getting in touch with others.</p>
<p>The monthly Meetups will be posted with a list of the currently available games, with the GM of each game describing what they're running, what to expect, and how to RSVP if there are any seats available for their game.</p>
<p>If you want to run a game at one of our meetups or anywhere else, please message one of the Admins for access.</p>
