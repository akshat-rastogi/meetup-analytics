22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings.

I am keen to meet other like-minded folk who have an interest in this area - all levels of knowledge/experience/consciousness are welcome! The main intention of this group is to have some interesting discussions and perhaps learn something from each other, whilst hopefully having some fun as well!</p>
<p>The plan will be to meet once a month/every 6 weeks and there will be a topic for each meetup - this may relate to a podcast that we have all listened to beforehand, or a Youtube video we have watched, or maybe just a general discussion topic.</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Copenhagen,DK,1428405022000,"Conscious Talks er et nyt event forum i København, hvor det handler om at turde stille konstruktive spørgsmål om alt det, vi går og taler om. Det handler ikke blot om det emne vi tager op, men også den måde vi italesætter det på, spørger ind til det og ser det fra flere vinkler.

Formålet med Conscious Talks er ikke at jage efter nye smarte synspunkter i forsøget på at hæve sig over anonymiteten, men at nå en dybere indsigt i vor tids vigtigste problemstillinger.

Vi tager snakken til næste niveau, hvor det indre snakketøj stille lytter til Hjertets uforfærdede spørgsmål, der samtidig bringer os i berøring med alle tabooerne, de små hvide løgne, alt det vi tager for givet og sindets tilsyneladende pålidelige urværk, som mekanisk kører vor daglige ubevidste rutiner.

I Conscious Talks taler vi om videnskab & spiritualitet, sundhed & livsstil, sexualitet & parforhold, kunst & kultur, miljø & teknologi, alternativ research & nyheder, og ethvert andet aktuelt emne, som vi mener har brug for mere opmærksomhed og flere ærlige spørgsmål, end den offentlige debat normalt underholder os med.

Mod til at stille ansvarlige spørgsmål og kun at tale når du har noget at sige Hvad er ytringsfrihed uden friheden til at stille spørgsmål? I Conscious Talks ligger vi vægt på, at de rigtige spørgsmål stilles, og samtidig at de bedste redskaber og sande menneskelige egenskaber iværksættes, på en måde der gør os i stand til at søge dybere svar. Svar som ofte er mere nuancerede og overraskende, end de bekvemme og politisk korrekte, som medierne, vores kultur, Staten og diverse trossystemer tilbyder os.

I Conscious Talks tror vi på muligheden for at skabe forandring ved at tænke ud af boksen. Ikke fordi vi på anarkistisk vis vil bevise, at det er muligt at flygte fra boksen. Mere for at tage del i det kollektive ansvar, der er nødvendigt lige nu, ved at søge udvikling udenom den selvskabte indespærrede konsensus-trance.

Vi sigter mod at udfordre den herskende dagsorden ved at forny den måde vi tænker og taler om verden på, og samtidig tage fuldt ansvar for konsekvenserne af vores handlinger. Med andre ord: vi ønsker at bringe mere klarhed ind i en ofte forvirrende offentlig diskurs om alt det, som ubevidst sniger sig gennem vores filtre, uden vores hjertes og intellekts accept.

Ord er tveæggede sværd, som kan enten forråde eller tage dig til den menneskelig indsigts grænser. Tale uden diskrimination og uden at tage fuldt ansvar for, hvad det er du siger, kan nemt fører til unødvendig vold og amoral, som vi ser det gentage sig gang på gang i verden idag.

Conscious Talks søger at lede os mod gensidig forståelse, respekt, forsoning, anerkendelse, ny indsigt, sund fornuft og hjerteforbindelse. Det er derfor vi er mere interesseret i indhold, mening og essens, end i pynt, iscenesættelse og retorik. Vi værdsætter stilhed og kontemplation, fremfor at give udtryk for en holdning uden at have noget værdifuldt at bidrage med.

Conscious Talks er alt fra foredrag, dialog og debat til workshops, demonstrationer og guerilla-interviews, der søger at fange det mellemmenneskelige dramas dynamik, såvel som at give publikum mulighed for at vurdere om sandheden bliver fortalt, en del af den eller en løgn...

Foredragsholdere og gæster i Conscious Talks er derfor nøje udvalgt til både at inspirere og begejstre, analysere og spørge ind til, såvel som at demonstrere og udfordre. Formålet er at formidle information, viden og erfaringer, som vil give os allesammen mulighed for at udvide vores syn på verden og os selv.

Vi gør hele tiden vores bedste, for at skabe de bedste rammer for at saften og kraften i vores gæsters ærinde kan trænge igennem den høflige overflade og de sociale filtre, og gøre Conscious Talks til et værdifuldt bidrag til en lysere fremtid for os alle.

It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

Hungry for more. With no idea how to truly nourish themselves. This group is about creating more fulfillment, intimacy, passion and connection with ourselves and with others.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Family Constellations and would like to participate in workshops organized in Copenhagen and Denmark, this group is for you. <br>We will post information about regular Family Constellation workshops based in Copenhagen as well as few-days long workshops outside the city.</p>
<p><span>Who are we?</span></p>
<p><span>Przemek is a Reiki Grand Master, bioenergotherapist and Family Constellations Therapy facilitator. For more than 15 years, he has been effectively helping individuals, families, companies and organizations to healing themselves, their relationships and to deal with the consequences of events and situations that have occurred in their personal and professional lives. He has been leading Family Constellation workshops for 9 years in Poland and since 3 years also in Copenhagen. Przemek also offers personal sessions in Berlin, Copenhagen and Poznan:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>*&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts"">https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts</a></p>
<p>This is what Przemk says about his approach to Family Constellations:&nbsp;Systemic Constellations are not for everyone…They bring to light these things that are hidden, often difficult, contrary to expectations, previously believed concepts and wishes.A constellation can be successful only when a client comes with a real, serious and up-to-date problem, and not when he or she is prevention-focused (“everything is fine, but just in case…”), theoretically oriented (“I have toxic parents, something should be done about that”) nor acting just out of curiosity (“I’d like to constellate my family to see how the method works”).Furthermore, I encourage a 6-12 months long break between consecutive constellations. More often than not a desire for quicker participation in another constellations results from unwillingness to fully accept the message from the previous workshops. This kind of attitude seriously disturbs any potential progress, because the essence of constellating is to come to terms with an image received during each constellation (even if – seemingly – ended in failure), no to choose solutions congruent with our expectations or beliefs.Instead it is relevant to consult a constellator, not only before, but also – even more – after any constellation, so that a client is given the opportunity to perceive different aspects of changes resulted by constellation, so he or she can find, with the constellator’s help and support, a way to benefit from these changes as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Natalia and I am a Reiki Master and the organiser of Reiki Circle Copenhagen group. For more than 5 years I have been participating in Family Constellations under Przemek Dobak and have been the organiser for all his workshops in Denmark and abroad. I am fascinated by the field of bodywork and constantly seek to broaden my horizons through new practices. Forms such as 5 rhythms, tantra, shamanism, yoga and contemporary dance make a vivid background of experience which I love to integrate into my work. <br>*&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/"">https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>*</span><span><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/"">https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/</a></span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/highres_465998971.jpeg,465998971.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/600_465998971.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/thumb_465998971.jpeg,event,26534443,open,55.68000030517578,https://www.meetup.com/FamilyConstellationsCph/,12.569999694824219,23,Family and Systemic Constellations Copenhagen,5161786.0,Natalia,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/highres_256303365.jpeg,256303365.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/member_256303365.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/thumb_256303365.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Copenhagen,"[{'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellations', 'name': 'Family Constellations', 'id': 15521}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'family-systems', 'name': 'Family Systems', 'id': 22916}, {'urlkey': 'hellinger', 'name': 'Hellinger', 'id': 24036}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'constellations', 'name': 'Constellations', 'id': 67555}, {'urlkey': 'work-family-constellations', 'name': 'Work & Family Constellations', 'id': 418852}, {'urlkey': 'family-systemic-constellations', 'name': 'Family & Systemic constellations', 'id': 740072}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares', 'id': 1022652}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares-y-sistemicas', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares y Sistémicas', 'id': 1485512}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellation-systemic-constellation-work', 'name': 'Family Constellation & Systemic Constellation Work', 'id': 1514362}]",FamilyConstellationsCph,3600000,public,Members

The exponential expansion of scientific understanding and technological growth, increases in comfort and efficiency, has apparently given us an unprecedented control over the world and simultaneously an unprecedented lack of control of our mental capacities.</p>
<p>How can a modern man even begin to recover his birthright of the satisfaction of continuous personal growth, becoming the leader and... hero of his own life in such society? By re-framing his outlook on the difficulties he faces in life confronting one of the most satisfying and useful challenges of a lifetime: mastery and control of his mental capacities. At this seminar we will discuss -developing a healthy masculine view on life -unique techniques for enhancing mental performance -systematic practices for time management -revolutionary methodologies for setting and meeting goals Modern western men in particular are struggling with stagnating consciousness and mental weakness. Our culture’s enthusiastic quest for comfort and safety has sabotaged and devalued the most fundamental mechanism for masculine growth: the facing and overcoming of challenges. As our society removes more and more of these fundamental challenges, masculine development is increasingly stunted. Thus we face more and more problems resulting from immature and destructive masculinity such as increased violent crime and drug use, psycho mental disorders and depression, various health crisis such as cancer and heart disease, a widening gap in educational and professional achievement between the sexes.</p>

But most decision makers are not formally educated as ""decision makers"". When you make decisions, you take the risc that reality don´t turn out the way you calculated and hoped for, you...</p>
<p>1) Get confused&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Make a mistake</span></p>
<p>3) Lose an opportunity</p>
<p>4) Make a failure</p>
<p>5) Get a loss</p>
<p>6) Become uncertain</p>
<p>If this happens, you have lost your ""self-control""!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things happen only when you have mishandled a known or unknown risc before you made your decision, and miscalculated the consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to control risc by making an unknown risc into a known risc is important in maintaining self-control. The ability to foresee and predict the positive and negative consequences of decisions is another important part of maintaining self-control. The NEWS is that this can be taught systematically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU can learn it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will improve your carreer and general quality of your life!</p>
<p>We have developed a new course in Decision Psychology to give you the new insigths and competences on self-control. On this course we will explain the new theory behind Decision Psychology (based on the brain and entropy/doubt) and educate you in tools that will help you achieve a higher level of self-control in your decision making. This will happen when you learn how your decision system works and how you can control it. Applying this in real life is the ambition of Decision Psychology! You will increase your empathic resources, and this will make you more able to understand, work and deal with other people when making decisions.</p>
<p>Decision Psychology is based on new knowledge about how doubt, and systematized questions and answers, drives living organisms decisions, and especially the brain´s decisions. A new book and several training courses during 2017, has made it possible for us to create a formal education in ""decision making"" applying this new knowledge. Everybody with ambitions as a decision maker, should participate to learn the insights that will lift anybody´s decision making competences to a higher level.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Copenhagen,DK,1428405022000,"Conscious Talks er et nyt event forum i København, hvor det handler om at turde stille konstruktive spørgsmål om alt det, vi går og taler om. Det handler ikke blot om det emne vi tager op, men også den måde vi italesætter det på, spørger ind til det og ser det fra flere vinkler.

Formålet med Conscious Talks er ikke at jage efter nye smarte synspunkter i forsøget på at hæve sig over anonymiteten, men at nå en dybere indsigt i vor tids vigtigste problemstillinger.

Vi tager snakken til næste niveau, hvor det indre snakketøj stille lytter til Hjertets uforfærdede spørgsmål, der samtidig bringer os i berøring med alle tabooerne, de små hvide løgne, alt det vi tager for givet og sindets tilsyneladende pålidelige urværk, som mekanisk kører vor daglige ubevidste rutiner.

I Conscious Talks taler vi om videnskab & spiritualitet, sundhed & livsstil, sexualitet & parforhold, kunst & kultur, miljø & teknologi, alternativ research & nyheder, og ethvert andet aktuelt emne, som vi mener har brug for mere opmærksomhed og flere ærlige spørgsmål, end den offentlige debat normalt underholder os med.

Mod til at stille ansvarlige spørgsmål og kun at tale når du har noget at sige Hvad er ytringsfrihed uden friheden til at stille spørgsmål? I Conscious Talks ligger vi vægt på, at de rigtige spørgsmål stilles, og samtidig at de bedste redskaber og sande menneskelige egenskaber iværksættes, på en måde der gør os i stand til at søge dybere svar. Svar som ofte er mere nuancerede og overraskende, end de bekvemme og politisk korrekte, som medierne, vores kultur, Staten og diverse trossystemer tilbyder os.

I Conscious Talks tror vi på muligheden for at skabe forandring ved at tænke ud af boksen. Ikke fordi vi på anarkistisk vis vil bevise, at det er muligt at flygte fra boksen. Mere for at tage del i det kollektive ansvar, der er nødvendigt lige nu, ved at søge udvikling udenom den selvskabte indespærrede konsensus-trance.

Vi sigter mod at udfordre den herskende dagsorden ved at forny den måde vi tænker og taler om verden på, og samtidig tage fuldt ansvar for konsekvenserne af vores handlinger. Med andre ord: vi ønsker at bringe mere klarhed ind i en ofte forvirrende offentlig diskurs om alt det, som ubevidst sniger sig gennem vores filtre, uden vores hjertes og intellekts accept.

Ord er tveæggede sværd, som kan enten forråde eller tage dig til den menneskelig indsigts grænser. Tale uden diskrimination og uden at tage fuldt ansvar for, hvad det er du siger, kan nemt fører til unødvendig vold og amoral, som vi ser det gentage sig gang på gang i verden idag.

Conscious Talks søger at lede os mod gensidig forståelse, respekt, forsoning, anerkendelse, ny indsigt, sund fornuft og hjerteforbindelse. Det er derfor vi er mere interesseret i indhold, mening og essens, end i pynt, iscenesættelse og retorik. Vi værdsætter stilhed og kontemplation, fremfor at give udtryk for en holdning uden at have noget værdifuldt at bidrage med.

Conscious Talks er alt fra foredrag, dialog og debat til workshops, demonstrationer og guerilla-interviews, der søger at fange det mellemmenneskelige dramas dynamik, såvel som at give publikum mulighed for at vurdere om sandheden bliver fortalt, en del af den eller en løgn...

Foredragsholdere og gæster i Conscious Talks er derfor nøje udvalgt til både at inspirere og begejstre, analysere og spørge ind til, såvel som at demonstrere og udfordre. Formålet er at formidle information, viden og erfaringer, som vil give os allesammen mulighed for at udvide vores syn på verden og os selv.

Vi gør hele tiden vores bedste, for at skabe de bedste rammer for at saften og kraften i vores gæsters ærinde kan trænge igennem den høflige overflade og de sociale filtre, og gøre Conscious Talks til et værdifuldt bidrag til en lysere fremtid for os alle.

<p>Learn how to speak with confidence, with respect, with your full being. And while having fun, harness the power of your feminine energy as you stand up to speak, lead and change our world.</p>
<p>You have a safe, hearing, supportive space to share your story, your mission, your passion. You can be an entrepreneur, blogger, stay at home mother, speaker, leader, any woman wanting to be hear - louder and free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WomenSpeak Copenhagen consists of local, ongoing, bi-monthly public speaking gatherings designed to offer women places for consistent practice in a&nbsp;fun, supportive and effective&nbsp;way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The women you circle with&nbsp;will always celebrate you and your voice.</span><br></p>
<p>At WomanSpeak er<b> LISTEN</b>. We <b>CELEBRATE</b>. We are not looking for what’s “wrong” in your speaking and how to “fix” it. Instead, we look for what is already brilliant and then, using our proven, unique public speaking techniques, we explore how to make it even more amazing, effective, and powerful.</p>
<p>We literally help women to re-wire their nervous systems so that speaking up becomes an experience of safety, power, joy and freedom.</p>

It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

Hungry for more. With no idea how to truly nourish themselves. This group is about creating more fulfillment, intimacy, passion and connection with ourselves and with others.</p> 
<p>It is about getting to know ourselves and (re)discovering who we truly are. &lt;br&gt;It is about letting go of the beliefs we have about who we need to be or should be and allowing ourselves be who we truly are. &lt;br&gt;It is about understanding what it means for us to be a man / a woman. &lt;br&gt;It is about fully embracing and stepping into our masculine / feminine – in all our relationships (with ourselves, with the same sex, with the opposite sex, at work, with our family, …) &lt;br&gt;It is about understanding others - the same or the opposite sex. &lt;br&gt;It is about learning to identify what we want, expressing it and learning to have it.</p>

<p>This is what Przemk says about his approach to Family Constellations:&nbsp;Systemic Constellations are not for everyone…They bring to light these things that are hidden, often difficult, contrary to expectations, previously believed concepts and wishes.A constellation can be successful only when a client comes with a real, serious and up-to-date problem, and not when he or she is prevention-focused (“everything is fine, but just in case…”), theoretically oriented (“I have toxic parents, something should be done about that”) nor acting just out of curiosity (“I’d like to constellate my family to see how the method works”).Furthermore, I encourage a 6-12 months long break between consecutive constellations. More often than not a desire for quicker participation in another constellations results from unwillingness to fully accept the message from the previous workshops. This kind of attitude seriously disturbs any potential progress, because the essence of constellating is to come to terms with an image received during each constellation (even if – seemingly – ended in failure), no to choose solutions congruent with our expectations or beliefs.Instead it is relevant to consult a constellator, not only before, but also – even more – after any constellation, so that a client is given the opportunity to perceive different aspects of changes resulted by constellation, so he or she can find, with the constellator’s help and support, a way to benefit from these changes as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Natalia and I am a Reiki Master and the organiser of Reiki Circle Copenhagen group. For more than 5 years I have been participating in Family Constellations under Przemek Dobak and have been the organiser for all his workshops in Denmark and abroad. I am fascinated by the field of bodywork and constantly seek to broaden my horizons through new practices. Forms such as 5 rhythms, tantra, shamanism, yoga and contemporary dance make a vivid background of experience which I love to integrate into my work. <br>*&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/"">https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>*</span><span><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/"">https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/</a></span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/highres_465998971.jpeg,465998971.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/600_465998971.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/thumb_465998971.jpeg,event,26534443,open,55.68000030517578,https://www.meetup.com/FamilyConstellationsCph/,12.569999694824219,23,Family and Systemic Constellations Copenhagen,5161786.0,Natalia,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/highres_256303365.jpeg,256303365.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/member_256303365.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/thumb_256303365.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Copenhagen,"[{'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellations', 'name': 'Family Constellations', 'id': 15521}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'family-systems', 'name': 'Family Systems', 'id': 22916}, {'urlkey': 'hellinger', 'name': 'Hellinger', 'id': 24036}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'constellations', 'name': 'Constellations', 'id': 67555}, {'urlkey': 'work-family-constellations', 'name': 'Work & Family Constellations', 'id': 418852}, {'urlkey': 'family-systemic-constellations', 'name': 'Family & Systemic constellations', 'id': 740072}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares', 'id': 1022652}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares-y-sistemicas', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares y Sistémicas', 'id': 1485512}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellation-systemic-constellation-work', 'name': 'Family Constellation & Systemic Constellation Work', 'id': 1514362}]",FamilyConstellationsCph,3600000,public,Members

The exponential expansion of scientific understanding and technological growth, increases in comfort and efficiency, has apparently given us an unprecedented control over the world and simultaneously an unprecedented lack of control of our mental capacities.</p>
<p>How can a modern man even begin to recover his birthright of the satisfaction of continuous personal growth, becoming the leader and... hero of his own life in such society? By re-framing his outlook on the difficulties he faces in life confronting one of the most satisfying and useful challenges of a lifetime: mastery and control of his mental capacities. At this seminar we will discuss -developing a healthy masculine view on life -unique techniques for enhancing mental performance -systematic practices for time management -revolutionary methodologies for setting and meeting goals Modern western men in particular are struggling with stagnating consciousness and mental weakness. Our culture’s enthusiastic quest for comfort and safety has sabotaged and devalued the most fundamental mechanism for masculine growth: the facing and overcoming of challenges. As our society removes more and more of these fundamental challenges, masculine development is increasingly stunted. Thus we face more and more problems resulting from immature and destructive masculinity such as increased violent crime and drug use, psycho mental disorders and depression, various health crisis such as cancer and heart disease, a widening gap in educational and professional achievement between the sexes.</p>

But most decision makers are not formally educated as ""decision makers"". When you make decisions, you take the risc that reality don´t turn out the way you calculated and hoped for, you...</p>
<p>1) Get confused&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Make a mistake</span></p>
<p>3) Lose an opportunity</p>
<p>4) Make a failure</p>
<p>5) Get a loss</p>
<p>6) Become uncertain</p>
<p>If this happens, you have lost your ""self-control""!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things happen only when you have mishandled a known or unknown risc before you made your decision, and miscalculated the consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to control risc by making an unknown risc into a known risc is important in maintaining self-control. The ability to foresee and predict the positive and negative consequences of decisions is another important part of maintaining self-control. The NEWS is that this can be taught systematically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU can learn it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will improve your carreer and general quality of your life!</p>
<p>We have developed a new course in Decision Psychology to give you the new insigths and competences on self-control. On this course we will explain the new theory behind Decision Psychology (based on the brain and entropy/doubt) and educate you in tools that will help you achieve a higher level of self-control in your decision making. This will happen when you learn how your decision system works and how you can control it. Applying this in real life is the ambition of Decision Psychology! You will increase your empathic resources, and this will make you more able to understand, work and deal with other people when making decisions.</p>
<p>Decision Psychology is based on new knowledge about how doubt, and systematized questions and answers, drives living organisms decisions, and especially the brain´s decisions. A new book and several training courses during 2017, has made it possible for us to create a formal education in ""decision making"" applying this new knowledge. Everybody with ambitions as a decision maker, should participate to learn the insights that will lift anybody´s decision making competences to a higher level. To test this new education, we give away a free course to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p>

I am keen to meet other like-minded folk who have an interest in this area - all levels of knowledge/experience/consciousness are welcome! The main intention of this group is to have some interesting discussions and perhaps learn something from each other, whilst hopefully having some fun as well!</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of.

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities. Welcome!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/e/7/highres_458175591.jpeg,458175591.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/e/7/600_458175591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/e/7/thumb_458175591.jpeg,event,22283267,approval,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Jesus-Dojo-Stockholm/,18.06999969482422,14,Jesus Dojo Stockholm,201241884.0,Samuel,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/0/2/d/highres_254637389.jpeg,254637389.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/0/2/d/member_254637389.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/0/2/d/thumb_254637389.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'meetup', 'name': 'Meetup', 'id': 1787}, {'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'fun-times', 'name': 'Fun Times', 'id': 15117}, {'urlkey': 'sustainability', 'name': 'Sustainability', 'id': 15998}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'boston-artists', 'name': 'Artists', 'id': 16573}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'creative', 'name': 'Creativity', 'id': 36229}]",Jesus-Dojo-Stockholm,3600000,public,wayers

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

(En grupp för alla som har klardrömmar eller vill lära sig att klardrömma. Lucid dreams are dreams where we know that we are dreaming. It starts with a hunch that ""maybe this is a dream"" and when we realize that we're dreaming, we can take control and do whatever we want. Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome!

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Copenhagen,DK,1428405022000,"Conscious Talks er et nyt event forum i København, hvor det handler om at turde stille konstruktive spørgsmål om alt det, vi går og taler om. Det handler ikke blot om det emne vi tager op, men også den måde vi italesætter det på, spørger ind til det og ser det fra flere vinkler.

Formålet med Conscious Talks er ikke at jage efter nye smarte synspunkter i forsøget på at hæve sig over anonymiteten, men at nå en dybere indsigt i vor tids vigtigste problemstillinger.

Vi tager snakken til næste niveau, hvor det indre snakketøj stille lytter til Hjertets uforfærdede spørgsmål, der samtidig bringer os i berøring med alle tabooerne, de små hvide løgne, alt det vi tager for givet og sindets tilsyneladende pålidelige urværk, som mekanisk kører vor daglige ubevidste rutiner.

I Conscious Talks taler vi om videnskab & spiritualitet, sundhed & livsstil, sexualitet & parforhold, kunst & kultur, miljø & teknologi, alternativ research & nyheder, og ethvert andet aktuelt emne, som vi mener har brug for mere opmærksomhed og flere ærlige spørgsmål, end den offentlige debat normalt underholder os med.

Mod til at stille ansvarlige spørgsmål og kun at tale når du har noget at sige Hvad er ytringsfrihed uden friheden til at stille spørgsmål? I Conscious Talks ligger vi vægt på, at de rigtige spørgsmål stilles, og samtidig at de bedste redskaber og sande menneskelige egenskaber iværksættes, på en måde der gør os i stand til at søge dybere svar. Svar som ofte er mere nuancerede og overraskende, end de bekvemme og politisk korrekte, som medierne, vores kultur, Staten og diverse trossystemer tilbyder os.

I Conscious Talks tror vi på muligheden for at skabe forandring ved at tænke ud af boksen. Ikke fordi vi på anarkistisk vis vil bevise, at det er muligt at flygte fra boksen. Mere for at tage del i det kollektive ansvar, der er nødvendigt lige nu, ved at søge udvikling udenom den selvskabte indespærrede konsensus-trance.

Vi sigter mod at udfordre den herskende dagsorden ved at forny den måde vi tænker og taler om verden på, og samtidig tage fuldt ansvar for konsekvenserne af vores handlinger. Med andre ord: vi ønsker at bringe mere klarhed ind i en ofte forvirrende offentlig diskurs om alt det, som ubevidst sniger sig gennem vores filtre, uden vores hjertes og intellekts accept.

Ord er tveæggede sværd, som kan enten forråde eller tage dig til den menneskelig indsigts grænser. Tale uden diskrimination og uden at tage fuldt ansvar for, hvad det er du siger, kan nemt fører til unødvendig vold og amoral, som vi ser det gentage sig gang på gang i verden idag.

Conscious Talks søger at lede os mod gensidig forståelse, respekt, forsoning, anerkendelse, ny indsigt, sund fornuft og hjerteforbindelse. Det er derfor vi er mere interesseret i indhold, mening og essens, end i pynt, iscenesættelse og retorik. Vi værdsætter stilhed og kontemplation, fremfor at give udtryk for en holdning uden at have noget værdifuldt at bidrage med.

Conscious Talks er alt fra foredrag, dialog og debat til workshops, demonstrationer og guerilla-interviews, der søger at fange det mellemmenneskelige dramas dynamik, såvel som at give publikum mulighed for at vurdere om sandheden bliver fortalt, en del af den eller en løgn...

Foredragsholdere og gæster i Conscious Talks er derfor nøje udvalgt til både at inspirere og begejstre, analysere og spørge ind til, såvel som at demonstrere og udfordre. Formålet er at formidle information, viden og erfaringer, som vil give os allesammen mulighed for at udvide vores syn på verden og os selv.

Vi gør hele tiden vores bedste, for at skabe de bedste rammer for at saften og kraften i vores gæsters ærinde kan trænge igennem den høflige overflade og de sociale filtre, og gøre Conscious Talks til et værdifuldt bidrag til en lysere fremtid for os alle.

It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

<p>If you are interested in Family Constellations and would like to participate in workshops organized in Copenhagen and Denmark, this group is for you. <br>We will post information about regular Family Constellation workshops based in Copenhagen as well as few-days long workshops outside the city.</p>
<p><span>Who are we?</span></p>
<p><span>Przemek is a Reiki Grand Master, bioenergotherapist and Family Constellations Therapy facilitator. For more than 15 years, he has been effectively helping individuals, families, companies and organizations to healing themselves, their relationships and to deal with the consequences of events and situations that have occurred in their personal and professional lives. He has been leading Family Constellation workshops for 9 years in Poland and since 3 years also in Copenhagen. Przemek also offers personal sessions in Berlin, Copenhagen and Poznan:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>*&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts"">https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts</a></p>
<p>This is what Przemk says about his approach to Family Constellations:&nbsp;Systemic Constellations are not for everyone…They bring to light these things that are hidden, often difficult, contrary to expectations, previously believed concepts and wishes.A constellation can be successful only when a client comes with a real, serious and up-to-date problem, and not when he or she is prevention-focused (“everything is fine, but just in case…”), theoretically oriented (“I have toxic parents, something should be done about that”) nor acting just out of curiosity (“I’d like to constellate my family to see how the method works”).Furthermore, I encourage a 6-12 months long break between consecutive constellations. More often than not a desire for quicker participation in another constellations results from unwillingness to fully accept the message from the previous workshops. This kind of attitude seriously disturbs any potential progress, because the essence of constellating is to come to terms with an image received during each constellation (even if – seemingly – ended in failure), no to choose solutions congruent with our expectations or beliefs.Instead it is relevant to consult a constellator, not only before, but also – even more – after any constellation, so that a client is given the opportunity to perceive different aspects of changes resulted by constellation, so he or she can find, with the constellator’s help and support, a way to benefit from these changes as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Natalia and I am a Reiki Master and the organiser of Reiki Circle Copenhagen group. For more than 5 years I have been participating in Family Constellations under Przemek Dobak and have been the organiser for all his workshops in Denmark and abroad. I am fascinated by the field of bodywork and constantly seek to broaden my horizons through new practices. Forms such as 5 rhythms, tantra, shamanism, yoga and contemporary dance make a vivid background of experience which I love to integrate into my work. <br>*&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/"">https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>*</span><span><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/"">https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/</a></span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/highres_465998971.jpeg,465998971.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/600_465998971.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/thumb_465998971.jpeg,event,26534443,open,55.68000030517578,https://www.meetup.com/FamilyConstellationsCph/,12.569999694824219,23,Family and Systemic Constellations Copenhagen,5161786.0,Natalia,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/highres_256303365.jpeg,256303365.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/member_256303365.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/thumb_256303365.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Copenhagen,"[{'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellations', 'name': 'Family Constellations', 'id': 15521}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'family-systems', 'name': 'Family Systems', 'id': 22916}, {'urlkey': 'hellinger', 'name': 'Hellinger', 'id': 24036}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'constellations', 'name': 'Constellations', 'id': 67555}, {'urlkey': 'work-family-constellations', 'name': 'Work & Family Constellations', 'id': 418852}, {'urlkey': 'family-systemic-constellations', 'name': 'Family & Systemic constellations', 'id': 740072}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares', 'id': 1022652}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares-y-sistemicas', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares y Sistémicas', 'id': 1485512}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellation-systemic-constellation-work', 'name': 'Family Constellation & Systemic Constellation Work', 'id': 1514362}]",FamilyConstellationsCph,3600000,public,Members

The exponential expansion of scientific understanding and technological growth, increases in comfort and efficiency, has apparently given us an unprecedented control over the world and simultaneously an unprecedented lack of control of our mental capacities.</p>
<p>How can a modern man even begin to recover his birthright of the satisfaction of continuous personal growth, becoming the leader and... hero of his own life in such society? By re-framing his outlook on the difficulties he faces in life confronting one of the most satisfying and useful challenges of a lifetime: mastery and control of his mental capacities. At this seminar we will discuss -developing a healthy masculine view on life -unique techniques for enhancing mental performance -systematic practices for time management -revolutionary methodologies for setting and meeting goals Modern western men in particular are struggling with stagnating consciousness and mental weakness. Our culture’s enthusiastic quest for comfort and safety has sabotaged and devalued the most fundamental mechanism for masculine growth: the facing and overcoming of challenges. As our society removes more and more of these fundamental challenges, masculine development is increasingly stunted. Thus we face more and more problems resulting from immature and destructive masculinity such as increased violent crime and drug use, psycho mental disorders and depression, various health crisis such as cancer and heart disease, a widening gap in educational and professional achievement between the sexes.</p>

But most decision makers are not formally educated as ""decision makers"". When you make decisions, you take the risc that reality don´t turn out the way you calculated and hoped for, you...</p>
<p>1) Get confused&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Make a mistake</span></p>
<p>3) Lose an opportunity</p>
<p>4) Make a failure</p>
<p>5) Get a loss</p>
<p>6) Become uncertain</p>
<p>If this happens, you have lost your ""self-control""!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things happen only when you have mishandled a known or unknown risc before you made your decision, and miscalculated the consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to control risc by making an unknown risc into a known risc is important in maintaining self-control. The ability to foresee and predict the positive and negative consequences of decisions is another important part of maintaining self-control. The NEWS is that this can be taught systematically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU can learn it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will improve your carreer and general quality of your life!</p>
<p>We have developed a new course in Decision Psychology to give you the new insigths and competences on self-control. On this course we will explain the new theory behind Decision Psychology (based on the brain and entropy/doubt) and educate you in tools that will help you achieve a higher level of self-control in your decision making. This will happen when you learn how your decision system works and how you can control it. Applying this in real life is the ambition of Decision Psychology! You will increase your empathic resources, and this will make you more able to understand, work and deal with other people when making decisions.</p>
<p>Decision Psychology is based on new knowledge about how doubt, and systematized questions and answers, drives living organisms decisions, and especially the brain´s decisions. A new book and several training courses during 2017, has made it possible for us to create a formal education in ""decision making"" applying this new knowledge. Everybody with ambitions as a decision maker, should participate to learn the insights that will lift anybody´s decision making competences to a higher level.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Malmö,SE,1497173946000,"<p>The Pneuma System is a path that leads to profound inner transformation and self-realisation. It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Copenhagen,DK,1428405022000,"Conscious Talks er et nyt event forum i København, hvor det handler om at turde stille konstruktive spørgsmål om alt det, vi går og taler om. Det handler ikke blot om det emne vi tager op, men også den måde vi italesætter det på, spørger ind til det og ser det fra flere vinkler.

Formålet med Conscious Talks er ikke at jage efter nye smarte synspunkter i forsøget på at hæve sig over anonymiteten, men at nå en dybere indsigt i vor tids vigtigste problemstillinger.

Vi tager snakken til næste niveau, hvor det indre snakketøj stille lytter til Hjertets uforfærdede spørgsmål, der samtidig bringer os i berøring med alle tabooerne, de små hvide løgne, alt det vi tager for givet og sindets tilsyneladende pålidelige urværk, som mekanisk kører vor daglige ubevidste rutiner.

I Conscious Talks taler vi om videnskab & spiritualitet, sundhed & livsstil, sexualitet & parforhold, kunst & kultur, miljø & teknologi, alternativ research & nyheder, og ethvert andet aktuelt emne, som vi mener har brug for mere opmærksomhed og flere ærlige spørgsmål, end den offentlige debat normalt underholder os med.

Mod til at stille ansvarlige spørgsmål og kun at tale når du har noget at sige Hvad er ytringsfrihed uden friheden til at stille spørgsmål? I Conscious Talks ligger vi vægt på, at de rigtige spørgsmål stilles, og samtidig at de bedste redskaber og sande menneskelige egenskaber iværksættes, på en måde der gør os i stand til at søge dybere svar. Svar som ofte er mere nuancerede og overraskende, end de bekvemme og politisk korrekte, som medierne, vores kultur, Staten og diverse trossystemer tilbyder os.

I Conscious Talks tror vi på muligheden for at skabe forandring ved at tænke ud af boksen. Ikke fordi vi på anarkistisk vis vil bevise, at det er muligt at flygte fra boksen. Mere for at tage del i det kollektive ansvar, der er nødvendigt lige nu, ved at søge udvikling udenom den selvskabte indespærrede konsensus-trance.

Vi sigter mod at udfordre den herskende dagsorden ved at forny den måde vi tænker og taler om verden på, og samtidig tage fuldt ansvar for konsekvenserne af vores handlinger. Med andre ord: vi ønsker at bringe mere klarhed ind i en ofte forvirrende offentlig diskurs om alt det, som ubevidst sniger sig gennem vores filtre, uden vores hjertes og intellekts accept.

Ord er tveæggede sværd, som kan enten forråde eller tage dig til den menneskelig indsigts grænser. Tale uden diskrimination og uden at tage fuldt ansvar for, hvad det er du siger, kan nemt fører til unødvendig vold og amoral, som vi ser det gentage sig gang på gang i verden idag.

Conscious Talks søger at lede os mod gensidig forståelse, respekt, forsoning, anerkendelse, ny indsigt, sund fornuft og hjerteforbindelse. Det er derfor vi er mere interesseret i indhold, mening og essens, end i pynt, iscenesættelse og retorik. Vi værdsætter stilhed og kontemplation, fremfor at give udtryk for en holdning uden at have noget værdifuldt at bidrage med.

Conscious Talks er alt fra foredrag, dialog og debat til workshops, demonstrationer og guerilla-interviews, der søger at fange det mellemmenneskelige dramas dynamik, såvel som at give publikum mulighed for at vurdere om sandheden bliver fortalt, en del af den eller en løgn...

Foredragsholdere og gæster i Conscious Talks er derfor nøje udvalgt til både at inspirere og begejstre, analysere og spørge ind til, såvel som at demonstrere og udfordre. Formålet er at formidle information, viden og erfaringer, som vil give os allesammen mulighed for at udvide vores syn på verden og os selv.

Vi gør hele tiden vores bedste, for at skabe de bedste rammer for at saften og kraften i vores gæsters ærinde kan trænge igennem den høflige overflade og de sociale filtre, og gøre Conscious Talks til et værdifuldt bidrag til en lysere fremtid for os alle.

It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

<p>If you are interested in Family Constellations and would like to participate in workshops organized in Copenhagen and Denmark, this group is for you. <br>We will post information about regular Family Constellation workshops based in Copenhagen as well as few-days long workshops outside the city.</p>
<p><span>Who are we?</span></p>
<p><span>Przemek is a Reiki Grand Master, bioenergotherapist and Family Constellations Therapy facilitator. For more than 15 years, he has been effectively helping individuals, families, companies and organizations to healing themselves, their relationships and to deal with the consequences of events and situations that have occurred in their personal and professional lives. He has been leading Family Constellation workshops for 9 years in Poland and since 3 years also in Copenhagen. Przemek also offers personal sessions in Berlin, Copenhagen and Poznan:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>*&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts"">https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts</a></p>
<p>This is what Przemk says about his approach to Family Constellations:&nbsp;Systemic Constellations are not for everyone…They bring to light these things that are hidden, often difficult, contrary to expectations, previously believed concepts and wishes.A constellation can be successful only when a client comes with a real, serious and up-to-date problem, and not when he or she is prevention-focused (“everything is fine, but just in case…”), theoretically oriented (“I have toxic parents, something should be done about that”) nor acting just out of curiosity (“I’d like to constellate my family to see how the method works”).Furthermore, I encourage a 6-12 months long break between consecutive constellations. More often than not a desire for quicker participation in another constellations results from unwillingness to fully accept the message from the previous workshops. This kind of attitude seriously disturbs any potential progress, because the essence of constellating is to come to terms with an image received during each constellation (even if – seemingly – ended in failure), no to choose solutions congruent with our expectations or beliefs.Instead it is relevant to consult a constellator, not only before, but also – even more – after any constellation, so that a client is given the opportunity to perceive different aspects of changes resulted by constellation, so he or she can find, with the constellator’s help and support, a way to benefit from these changes as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Natalia and I am a Reiki Master and the organiser of Reiki Circle Copenhagen group. For more than 5 years I have been participating in Family Constellations under Przemek Dobak and have been the organiser for all his workshops in Denmark and abroad. I am fascinated by the field of bodywork and constantly seek to broaden my horizons through new practices. Forms such as 5 rhythms, tantra, shamanism, yoga and contemporary dance make a vivid background of experience which I love to integrate into my work. <br>*&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/"">https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>*</span><span><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/"">https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/</a></span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/highres_465998971.jpeg,465998971.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/600_465998971.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/thumb_465998971.jpeg,event,26534443,open,55.68000030517578,https://www.meetup.com/FamilyConstellationsCph/,12.569999694824219,23,Family and Systemic Constellations Copenhagen,5161786.0,Natalia,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/highres_256303365.jpeg,256303365.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/member_256303365.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/thumb_256303365.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Copenhagen,"[{'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellations', 'name': 'Family Constellations', 'id': 15521}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'family-systems', 'name': 'Family Systems', 'id': 22916}, {'urlkey': 'hellinger', 'name': 'Hellinger', 'id': 24036}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'constellations', 'name': 'Constellations', 'id': 67555}, {'urlkey': 'work-family-constellations', 'name': 'Work & Family Constellations', 'id': 418852}, {'urlkey': 'family-systemic-constellations', 'name': 'Family & Systemic constellations', 'id': 740072}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares', 'id': 1022652}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares-y-sistemicas', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares y Sistémicas', 'id': 1485512}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellation-systemic-constellation-work', 'name': 'Family Constellation & Systemic Constellation Work', 'id': 1514362}]",FamilyConstellationsCph,3600000,public,Members

The exponential expansion of scientific understanding and technological growth, increases in comfort and efficiency, has apparently given us an unprecedented control over the world and simultaneously an unprecedented lack of control of our mental capacities.</p>
<p>How can a modern man even begin to recover his birthright of the satisfaction of continuous personal growth, becoming the leader and... hero of his own life in such society? By re-framing his outlook on the difficulties he faces in life confronting one of the most satisfying and useful challenges of a lifetime: mastery and control of his mental capacities. At this seminar we will discuss -developing a healthy masculine view on life -unique techniques for enhancing mental performance -systematic practices for time management -revolutionary methodologies for setting and meeting goals Modern western men in particular are struggling with stagnating consciousness and mental weakness. Our culture’s enthusiastic quest for comfort and safety has sabotaged and devalued the most fundamental mechanism for masculine growth: the facing and overcoming of challenges. As our society removes more and more of these fundamental challenges, masculine development is increasingly stunted. Thus we face more and more problems resulting from immature and destructive masculinity such as increased violent crime and drug use, psycho mental disorders and depression, various health crisis such as cancer and heart disease, a widening gap in educational and professional achievement between the sexes.</p>

But most decision makers are not formally educated as ""decision makers"". When you make decisions, you take the risc that reality don´t turn out the way you calculated and hoped for, you...</p>
<p>1) Get confused&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Make a mistake</span></p>
<p>3) Lose an opportunity</p>
<p>4) Make a failure</p>
<p>5) Get a loss</p>
<p>6) Become uncertain</p>
<p>If this happens, you have lost your ""self-control""!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things happen only when you have mishandled a known or unknown risc before you made your decision, and miscalculated the consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to control risc by making an unknown risc into a known risc is important in maintaining self-control. The ability to foresee and predict the positive and negative consequences of decisions is another important part of maintaining self-control. The NEWS is that this can be taught systematically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU can learn it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will improve your carreer and general quality of your life!</p>
<p>We have developed a new course in Decision Psychology to give you the new insigths and competences on self-control. On this course we will explain the new theory behind Decision Psychology (based on the brain and entropy/doubt) and educate you in tools that will help you achieve a higher level of self-control in your decision making. This will happen when you learn how your decision system works and how you can control it. Applying this in real life is the ambition of Decision Psychology! You will increase your empathic resources, and this will make you more able to understand, work and deal with other people when making decisions.</p>
<p>Decision Psychology is based on new knowledge about how doubt, and systematized questions and answers, drives living organisms decisions, and especially the brain´s decisions. A new book and several training courses during 2017, has made it possible for us to create a formal education in ""decision making"" applying this new knowledge. Everybody with ambitions as a decision maker, should participate to learn the insights that will lift anybody´s decision making competences to a higher level.

I am keen to meet other like-minded folk who have an interest in this area - all levels of knowledge/experience/consciousness are welcome! The main intention of this group is to have some interesting discussions and perhaps learn something from each other, whilst hopefully having some fun as well!</p>
<p>The plan will be to meet once a month/every 6 weeks and there will be a topic for each meetup - this may relate to a podcast that we have all listened to beforehand, or a Youtube video we have watched, or maybe just a general discussion topic.</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us.

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

It starts with a hunch that ""maybe this is a dream"" and when we realize that we're dreaming, we can take control and do whatever we want. Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together. Some people refer to lucid dreaming as ""astral projection"", but the distinction between the two is not sharp.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p>

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because.

<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p>

It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

We are many who feel the need of a platform where to discuss our spiritual journeys, here at planet earth. Hi! I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

<p>There are many different exercise fads in today's market but let's face it, yoga has endured the test of time. It gives physical, mental and spiritual benefits to its students. With the stresses of modern life, yoga provides the perfect escape from our increasingly complex, technologically driven lives. So why not come join us?</p>
<p>Our yoga classes run for an hour and fifteen minutes. We start with pranayama (breathing exercises), move through some easy Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa sequences (yoga flowing with breath) and finish with restorative postures along with savasana (total relaxation). Our yoga is a great way to socialise and meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Our Sunday meetup is free or by optional donation. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>We operate to bring affordable yoga to everybody so that yoga remains accessible as demand sours, teaching resources become stretched and prices soar. We ask for a small donation at the park yoga classes if you can afford and encourage you to come even if you cannot.</p>

I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1379002289000,"<p><strong>Are you noticing how lying gets in the way of things?&nbsp;<br> Do you want more real relationships in your life?</strong></p> 
<p><span>This group is for people like you who are working on becoming more honest to others. But also to ourselves by becoming more aware of how we get caught up in the stories in our head rather than our immediate experiences. It’s a group for people who want to grow beyond their ideas about what they are, aren't, should and shouldn't be, and start living a genuine life.</span></p> 
<p><strong>How can this group help you?</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span>You'll meet really cool, nice, supportive people.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll learn about YOU.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll get to be in a ""dojo"" of honesty and get to practice and develop your communication skills.</span></li> 
 <li><span>You'll develop your courage and help others do the same.</span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Happiness</strong><br> That's what we all want in the end, don't we? All negative emotions have a component of lying to it. Shame, for example, only survives in the dark, so to get rid of it we must shed light on it. We cannot change our emotions or behaviours until we admit they're there and own them fully. The core of our meetings is to notice the lies that permeate our thoughts, words and actions.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Honesty is not a principle.<br> </span></strong><span>It's not something we aspire to do all the time just because. It's a tool, and together we learn how and when to use it to create meaningful relationships and a simpler life. Without honesty there cannot be intimacy, trust, acceptance or love.</span></p> 
<p>To join this group, all you need is a bit of courage to speak the truth. No topics are off-limits because no part of you will be off-limits if you wish to share it with us. You'll get a space where you can talk openly about yourself and what you're dealing with, and together we'll share notes on how to not piss ourselves off so much.</p> 
<p>Feel free to send a raven or shoot me a private message any time; I'd love to hear from you.<br> <br> <em>""Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us with nothing to keep track of. We can simply be ourselves in every moment.""</em><br> <span>— Sam Harris</span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/highres_433997161.jpeg,433997161.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/600_433997161.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/0/9/thumb_433997161.jpeg,event,10232122,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/conversations-about-honesty/,18.06999969482422,419,Conversations About Honesty,103174862.0,Antonio Caruzo,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/highres_249918112.jpeg,249918112.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/member_249918112.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/6/c/0/thumb_249918112.jpeg,member,4.69,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'leadership', 'name': 'Leadership', 'id': 15121}, {'urlkey': 'intimacy', 'name': 'Intimacy', 'id': 15187}, {'urlkey': 'personal-development', 'name': 'Personal Development', 'id': 16468}, {'urlkey': 'radical-honesty', 'name': 'Radical Honesty', 'id': 22945}, {'urlkey': 'self-awareness', 'name': 'Self-Awareness', 'id': 25179}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'authenticity', 'name': 'Authenticity', 'id': 31009}, {'urlkey': 'connection', 'name': 'Connection', 'id': 37656}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}, {'urlkey': 'honesty', 'name': 'Honesty', 'id': 85105}]",conversations-about-honesty,3600000,public,Truthtellers

It starts with a hunch that ""maybe this is a dream"" and when we realize that we're dreaming, we can take control and do whatever we want. Flying, teleporting, visiting amazingly beautiful places, talking with interesting people or exploring unusual emotional states; the possibilities are endless. To practice, everything starts during the day, by doing certain exercises that eventually will affect our dreams in a positive way. There are several techniques. Some people are natural lucid dreamers, other require a lot of practice. It doesn't matter: If you are interested in increasing awareness, you're welcome! We will meet to talk and share inspiration and techniques. Depending on interest, we might also do exercises and ""walking meditations"" together. Some people refer to lucid dreaming as ""astral projection"", but the distinction between the two is not sharp.

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Stockholm,SE,1486539597000,"<p>Dojo is from the Japanese language and would translate into ""the place of the way"" - most commonly used is in martial arts, a karate dojo is a place to practice the way of Karate. A Jesus Dojo therefore is a place to practice the way of Jesus. In this meetup we will seek and ask questions about the teachings of Jesus and what was the way he ment for us to live when he said things like ""come follow me"" and ""I am the way""? The meetup is ment to be more practical than theoretical even though we surely will read and study.</p>
<p>As an example I could give this: When Jesus taught people and said ""anyone who has two coats and sees a man that has none should give away one of his coats"" - In our western society we own tons of stuff... What would it look like if we started giving away half of our stuff to people without stuff? Could that be a practical step to fight poverty? And when Jesus taught - ""Love your enemies"". What would that look like, say on social media platforms like Facebook, where people tend to comment rather nasty things to people of other views than themselves. In all things Jesus way is a way in to the Kingdom of Love and that is what we hopefully will explore. The Dojo is open to everyone, believer and non, but one has to stay open minded to references to spiritual matters and some God-talk. Hopefully this can challenge us in our worldview and open us up to other possibilities.

I'm Mona Mörtling (swede), and I felt called to shine the light at our ways, together we can create our most desired dreams of the life we want to live. I am the Country Coordinator for Humanity's Team Sweden and also the chairman of a non-profit-organization called Life In Motion. My role is (among others) to help people give them back to them selves, to find the way to truly live your purpose in this lifetime. I'm a spiritual teacher, lecturer, and entrepreneur. I am also life coach (both for business and private) and a certified NLP- Practitioner. <br>TIME is of essences, it's the most valuable thing we have, and it's time to AWAKEN THE SPECIES! We will do that by gather in a monthly book-club and outbreaks in fun and developing workshops, lectures and other 'tools' we find worthy our cause. <br>If YOU feel called to participate, you will find more inner peace, stress-relief, better sleep, healthier attitudes to your daily living, breaking the circle of feeling lonely, having new friends, doing fun creative things together, smile and feel more JOY in life! You are called to this by your inner self, your higher wisdom or source, nothing is a 'coincident', you where meant to see this... So, follow your gut and follow us at the autumn upstart of LIFE IN MOTION: <br>We will start our bookcircle this fall again, and we will have physical meetings with discussion groups. This term we read 'God's message to the world; You've got me all wrong 'by Neale Donald Walsch. We read and discuss in English and Swedish, depending on the group participants....Note, this is NOT attached to any specific religion or culture. Even though we may touch these issues, we are not a religious organisation or church. We are gathered to see and discuss more of what's uniting us, than the opposite. You can still have and believe in your chosen religion and culture, and anyway discuss what's important for us together, as humans.</p>

<p><br>Do you have a wish to develop your spirituality?</p> 
<p>Do you have a wish to develop your intuition and your consciousness?</p> 
<p>Would you like to let go of unresolved issues from the past?</p> 
<p>Have you experienced difficult traumas in your life and have been searching for a way to heal yourself holistically; psychologically, physically, and spiritually?</p> 
<p>Are you currently going through a life crises and seek for deep inner wisdom and insights?</p> 
<p><br>If your answer is ”yes” to one or more of these questions, there is a strong possibility that you could benefit from Holotropic Breathwork. You don’t need any previous experience of Holotropic Breathwork to be able to participate in a workshop. You don’t need to be an educated psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or such either. What is Holotropic Breathwork?</p> 
<p>The word ”holotropic” derives from the Greek words ”holos”=whole and trepein= to move towards which means moving towards wholeness. Holotropic Breathwork is based on 50 years of extensive research within psychological, psychotherapeutical, and a spiritual framework and has been developed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof (MD) and his wife Christina Grof. Stanislav Grof is one of the cofounders of Transpersonal Psychology since 1969 and is one of its foremost theoretics.<br>Important parts of Holotropic Breathwork is driving music, focused energy release work, sharing circle, and creative mandala drawings. All these parts facilitate for us opening up our own inner potential to reach deep physical, psychological and spiritual healing.<br>One could say that Holotropic Breathwork in this way creates a bridge between the psyche, the body and the soul and therefore is a holistic way of healing oneself.</p> 
<p>My name is Kajsa Soderlund and I am a certified facilitator since 2001 by Grof Transpersonal Training. I offer workshops in holotropic breathwork in a very safe, supportive amd loving atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Holotropic breathwork is a beautiful, transformative way of inner healing with the use of the breath.</p>",,,,,,,26801787,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-NBklIKiK/,18.06999969482422,125,Stockholm Wellness Meetup,243275875.0,Kajsa Soderlund,,,,,,,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'lifetransform', 'name': 'Life Transformation', 'id': 8702}, {'urlkey': 'wellness', 'name': 'Wellness', 'id': 10306}, {'urlkey': 'inspirational', 'name': 'Inspirational', 'id': 16074}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'evolution-of-consciousness', 'name': 'Evolution of Consciousness', 'id': 27989}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'self-empowerment', 'name': 'Self-Empowerment', 'id': 38757}]",meetup-group-NBklIKiK,3600000,public,Members

22,new age/spirituality,new-age-spirituality,Copenhagen,DK,1428405022000,"Conscious Talks er et nyt event forum i København, hvor det handler om at turde stille konstruktive spørgsmål om alt det, vi går og taler om. Det handler ikke blot om det emne vi tager op, men også den måde vi italesætter det på, spørger ind til det og ser det fra flere vinkler.

Formålet med Conscious Talks er ikke at jage efter nye smarte synspunkter i forsøget på at hæve sig over anonymiteten, men at nå en dybere indsigt i vor tids vigtigste problemstillinger.

Vi tager snakken til næste niveau, hvor det indre snakketøj stille lytter til Hjertets uforfærdede spørgsmål, der samtidig bringer os i berøring med alle tabooerne, de små hvide løgne, alt det vi tager for givet og sindets tilsyneladende pålidelige urværk, som mekanisk kører vor daglige ubevidste rutiner.

I Conscious Talks taler vi om videnskab & spiritualitet, sundhed & livsstil, sexualitet & parforhold, kunst & kultur, miljø & teknologi, alternativ research & nyheder, og ethvert andet aktuelt emne, som vi mener har brug for mere opmærksomhed og flere ærlige spørgsmål, end den offentlige debat normalt underholder os med.

Mod til at stille ansvarlige spørgsmål og kun at tale når du har noget at sige Hvad er ytringsfrihed uden friheden til at stille spørgsmål? I Conscious Talks ligger vi vægt på, at de rigtige spørgsmål stilles, og samtidig at de bedste redskaber og sande menneskelige egenskaber iværksættes, på en måde der gør os i stand til at søge dybere svar. Svar som ofte er mere nuancerede og overraskende, end de bekvemme og politisk korrekte, som medierne, vores kultur, Staten og diverse trossystemer tilbyder os.

I Conscious Talks tror vi på muligheden for at skabe forandring ved at tænke ud af boksen. Ikke fordi vi på anarkistisk vis vil bevise, at det er muligt at flygte fra boksen. Mere for at tage del i det kollektive ansvar, der er nødvendigt lige nu, ved at søge udvikling udenom den selvskabte indespærrede konsensus-trance.

Vi sigter mod at udfordre den herskende dagsorden ved at forny den måde vi tænker og taler om verden på, og samtidig tage fuldt ansvar for konsekvenserne af vores handlinger. Med andre ord: vi ønsker at bringe mere klarhed ind i en ofte forvirrende offentlig diskurs om alt det, som ubevidst sniger sig gennem vores filtre, uden vores hjertes og intellekts accept.

Ord er tveæggede sværd, som kan enten forråde eller tage dig til den menneskelig indsigts grænser. Tale uden diskrimination og uden at tage fuldt ansvar for, hvad det er du siger, kan nemt fører til unødvendig vold og amoral, som vi ser det gentage sig gang på gang i verden idag.

Conscious Talks søger at lede os mod gensidig forståelse, respekt, forsoning, anerkendelse, ny indsigt, sund fornuft og hjerteforbindelse. Det er derfor vi er mere interesseret i indhold, mening og essens, end i pynt, iscenesættelse og retorik. Vi værdsætter stilhed og kontemplation, fremfor at give udtryk for en holdning uden at have noget værdifuldt at bidrage med.

Conscious Talks er alt fra foredrag, dialog og debat til workshops, demonstrationer og guerilla-interviews, der søger at fange det mellemmenneskelige dramas dynamik, såvel som at give publikum mulighed for at vurdere om sandheden bliver fortalt, en del af den eller en løgn...

Foredragsholdere og gæster i Conscious Talks er derfor nøje udvalgt til både at inspirere og begejstre, analysere og spørge ind til, såvel som at demonstrere og udfordre. Formålet er at formidle information, viden og erfaringer, som vil give os allesammen mulighed for at udvide vores syn på verden og os selv.

Vi gør hele tiden vores bedste, for at skabe de bedste rammer for at saften og kraften i vores gæsters ærinde kan trænge igennem den høflige overflade og de sociale filtre, og gøre Conscious Talks til et værdifuldt bidrag til en lysere fremtid for os alle.

It is a path of synthesis, which brings together the inner wisdom of the major traditions of the world, integrates psychological and spiritual teachings, and thus offers a new perspective of self-knowledge and inner work that constitutes a unique understanding of personal processes and the progressive healing of the human soul. The word Pneuma means Spirit in Greek and refers to the sacred ‘Breath of Life’ that animates and pervades all of creation. The major instrument of Pneuma System is Pneuma Breathwork. This is a therapeutic method which has the central objective of recuperating a deeper awareness of the sacredness of life. It is a revolutionary, deep and easy to do practice that leads naturally to extraordinary or transpersonal states. These states allow for the exploration of the most subtle and refined internal dimensions of the psyche. The goal is to open our perception to the deepest and most unknown contents of the psyche so as to connect with our inner peace leading in this way to the gradual healing of our life and liberation from suffering.

<p>If you are interested in Family Constellations and would like to participate in workshops organized in Copenhagen and Denmark, this group is for you. <br>We will post information about regular Family Constellation workshops based in Copenhagen as well as few-days long workshops outside the city.</p>
<p><span>Who are we?</span></p>
<p><span>Przemek is a Reiki Grand Master, bioenergotherapist and Family Constellations Therapy facilitator. For more than 15 years, he has been effectively helping individuals, families, companies and organizations to healing themselves, their relationships and to deal with the consequences of events and situations that have occurred in their personal and professional lives. He has been leading Family Constellation workshops for 9 years in Poland and since 3 years also in Copenhagen. Przemek also offers personal sessions in Berlin, Copenhagen and Poznan:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>*&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts"">https://www.facebook.com/przemekdobak/?fref=ts</a></p>
<p>This is what Przemk says about his approach to Family Constellations:&nbsp;Systemic Constellations are not for everyone…They bring to light these things that are hidden, often difficult, contrary to expectations, previously believed concepts and wishes.A constellation can be successful only when a client comes with a real, serious and up-to-date problem, and not when he or she is prevention-focused (“everything is fine, but just in case…”), theoretically oriented (“I have toxic parents, something should be done about that”) nor acting just out of curiosity (“I’d like to constellate my family to see how the method works”).Furthermore, I encourage a 6-12 months long break between consecutive constellations. More often than not a desire for quicker participation in another constellations results from unwillingness to fully accept the message from the previous workshops. This kind of attitude seriously disturbs any potential progress, because the essence of constellating is to come to terms with an image received during each constellation (even if – seemingly – ended in failure), no to choose solutions congruent with our expectations or beliefs.Instead it is relevant to consult a constellator, not only before, but also – even more – after any constellation, so that a client is given the opportunity to perceive different aspects of changes resulted by constellation, so he or she can find, with the constellator’s help and support, a way to benefit from these changes as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Natalia and I am a Reiki Master and the organiser of Reiki Circle Copenhagen group. For more than 5 years I have been participating in Family Constellations under Przemek Dobak and have been the organiser for all his workshops in Denmark and abroad. I am fascinated by the field of bodywork and constantly seek to broaden my horizons through new practices. Forms such as 5 rhythms, tantra, shamanism, yoga and contemporary dance make a vivid background of experience which I love to integrate into my work. <br>*&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/"">https://www.facebook.com/reikicopenhagen/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>*</span><span><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/"">https://www.meetup.com/Reiki-Circle-Copenhagen/</a></span></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/highres_465998971.jpeg,465998971.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/600_465998971.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/3/b/thumb_465998971.jpeg,event,26534443,open,55.68000030517578,https://www.meetup.com/FamilyConstellationsCph/,12.569999694824219,23,Family and Systemic Constellations Copenhagen,5161786.0,Natalia,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/highres_256303365.jpeg,256303365.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/member_256303365.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/6/5/thumb_256303365.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Copenhagen,"[{'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellations', 'name': 'Family Constellations', 'id': 15521}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'family-systems', 'name': 'Family Systems', 'id': 22916}, {'urlkey': 'hellinger', 'name': 'Hellinger', 'id': 24036}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'constellations', 'name': 'Constellations', 'id': 67555}, {'urlkey': 'work-family-constellations', 'name': 'Work & Family Constellations', 'id': 418852}, {'urlkey': 'family-systemic-constellations', 'name': 'Family & Systemic constellations', 'id': 740072}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares', 'id': 1022652}, {'urlkey': 'constelaciones-familiares-y-sistemicas', 'name': 'Constelaciones Familiares y Sistémicas', 'id': 1485512}, {'urlkey': 'family-constellation-systemic-constellation-work', 'name': 'Family Constellation & Systemic Constellation Work', 'id': 1514362}]",FamilyConstellationsCph,3600000,public,Members

The exponential expansion of scientific understanding and technological growth, increases in comfort and efficiency, has apparently given us an unprecedented control over the world and simultaneously an unprecedented lack of control of our mental capacities.</p>
<p>How can a modern man even begin to recover his birthright of the satisfaction of continuous personal growth, becoming the leader and... hero of his own life in such society? By re-framing his outlook on the difficulties he faces in life confronting one of the most satisfying and useful challenges of a lifetime: mastery and control of his mental capacities. At this seminar we will discuss -developing a healthy masculine view on life -unique techniques for enhancing mental performance -systematic practices for time management -revolutionary methodologies for setting and meeting goals Modern western men in particular are struggling with stagnating consciousness and mental weakness. Our culture’s enthusiastic quest for comfort and safety has sabotaged and devalued the most fundamental mechanism for masculine growth: the facing and overcoming of challenges. As our society removes more and more of these fundamental challenges, masculine development is increasingly stunted. Thus we face more and more problems resulting from immature and destructive masculinity such as increased violent crime and drug use, psycho mental disorders and depression, various health crisis such as cancer and heart disease, a widening gap in educational and professional achievement between the sexes.</p>

But most decision makers are not formally educated as ""decision makers"". When you make decisions, you take the risc that reality don´t turn out the way you calculated and hoped for, you...</p>
<p>1) Get confused&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Make a mistake</span></p>
<p>3) Lose an opportunity</p>
<p>4) Make a failure</p>
<p>5) Get a loss</p>
<p>6) Become uncertain</p>
<p>If this happens, you have lost your ""self-control""!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These things happen only when you have mishandled a known or unknown risc before you made your decision, and miscalculated the consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to control risc by making an unknown risc into a known risc is important in maintaining self-control. The ability to foresee and predict the positive and negative consequences of decisions is another important part of maintaining self-control. The NEWS is that this can be taught systematically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU can learn it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will improve your carreer and general quality of your life!</p>
<p>We have developed a new course in Decision Psychology to give you the new insigths and competences on self-control. On this course we will explain the new theory behind Decision Psychology (based on the brain and entropy/doubt) and educate you in tools that will help you achieve a higher level of self-control in your decision making. This will happen when you learn how your decision system works and how you can control it. Applying this in real life is the ambition of Decision Psychology! You will increase your empathic resources, and this will make you more able to understand, work and deal with other people when making decisions.</p>
<p>Decision Psychology is based on new knowledge about how doubt, and systematized questions and answers, drives living organisms decisions, and especially the brain´s decisions. A new book and several training courses during 2017, has made it possible for us to create a formal education in ""decision making"" applying this new knowledge. Everybody with ambitions as a decision maker, should participate to learn the insights that will lift anybody´s decision making competences to a higher level.

We meet each solstice and equinox, work with a theme that the leader is guided to, based on participants' needs and the world's spiritual path. Based in Druid, Scandinavian, Mayan and other traditions, deep healing, profound insights, clarity and empowerment, grace and transformation happens during these beautiful ceremonies and beyond, as we allow spiritual guides to support our path.<br>There is always a bonus activity, relating to theme of the ceremony.<br>Each ceremony builds and boosts the energies of previous ones, so it is beneficial to continue attending at each equinox and solstice.

We come together to practice mindfulness in order to take care of ourselves, nourish happiness, and contribute to building a healthier and a more compassionate society.</p> 
<p>We want to help our world which is overloaded with intolerance, discrimination, craving, anger and despair. Seeing the environmental degradation caused by our society, we want to live in such a way that our planet Earth can survive for a long time.</p> 
<p>Practicing mindfulness, concentration and insight, enables us to cultivate tolerance, non-discrimination, understanding and compassion in ourselves and the world.</p> 
<p>We aspire to be a place of refuge, nourishment and support for anyone with an aspiration to transform their own suffering and contribute to a healthy and compassionate society. We gather weekly or monthly in Wake Up groups to practice sitting and walking meditation, to listen to a teaching, practice total relaxation, listen deeply to one another, and recite the Five Mindfulness Trainings.</p>",,,,,,,27090453,open,55.61000061035156,https://www.meetup.com/Wake-Up-Malmo-mindfulness/,13.020000457763672,50,Wake Up Malmö - mindfulness,236671098.0,Ana Maria Clara Martinez,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/3/9/1/highres_270710065.jpeg,270710065.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/3/9/1/member_270710065.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/3/9/1/thumb_270710065.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'meditation', 'name': 'Meditation', 'id': 1322}, {'urlkey': 'self-improvement', 'name': 'Self-Improvement', 'id': 3336}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'spirituality', 'name': 'Spirituality', 'id': 10290}, {'urlkey': 'mindfulness', 'name': 'Mindfulness', 'id': 15920}, {'urlkey': 'stress-relief', 'name': 'Stress Relief', 'id': 17075}, {'urlkey': 'spiritual-growth', 'name': 'Spiritual Growth', 'id': 17658}, {'urlkey': 'thich-nhat-hanh', 'name': 'Thich Nhat Hanh', 'id': 17905}, {'urlkey': 'transformation', 'name': 'Transformation', 'id': 21591}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}, {'urlkey': 'mindful-living', 'name': 'Mindful Living', 'id': 66828}, {'urlkey': 'mindfulness-meditation', 'name': 'Mindfulness Meditation', 'id': 70577}, {'urlkey': 'buddhist-sangha', 'name': 'Buddhist Sangha', 'id': 166603}, {'urlkey': 'plum-village-tradition', 'name': 'Plum Village tradition', 'id': 826632}, {'urlkey': 'teachings-of-thich-nhat-hahn', 'name': 'Teachings of Thich Nhat Hahn', 'id': 1402862}]",Wake-Up-Malmo-mindfulness,3600000,public,Members
