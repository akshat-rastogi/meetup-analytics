1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1428591945000,"<p>The <strong>Stockholm Drawing Meetup</strong> is a group that has been up and running since April 2015 by <b>volunteers</b>, with the intention of meeting and getting creative together and socialize.</p>
<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

The CTC is an English-language amateur theatre company that has been performing high-quality theatre in Copenhagen since 1968. We usually put on three full-scale shows each year, in the spring, autumn and winter (the winter production being a British pantomime). We hold open auditions for our shows, which means that anyone is free to audition. Apart from actors, our membership includes directors, stage managers, designers, technicians, costume people, set builders, PR people and a myriad of others who make our shows work.</p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to become a CTC member and join us in one or more of these activities then please go to our website at <em><a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a></em> and click on ”Get Involved” in the top menu.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Besides our regular Meetups, we encourage our members to be creative and come with their own project proposals. These can take any form as long as it has something to do with the performing arts. So, for example, if you’re burning to perform that play you’ve just written, put together a project and we’ll most likely support you! Don't be shy! Come along and have some fun. You'll meet great people and who knows, you might just find yourself under the bright lights one day ... <br></span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to keep an eye on what we're up to, either follow us here on Meet Up, keep an eye on our website (<a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a>), Like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)"">https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)</a> or even follow us on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)"">https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Or perhaps imagine yourself, a fully grown adult, being given a permission to act like a little kid again, when everything you create on stage is as real as the bright shiny red ball that someone now is bouncing on the floor as we speak&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>This is exactly how life goes here, at Malmö Improvisatorium! Silly laughs, enchanting improv games and a fantastic atmosphere are guaranteed to open up your endless flow of fantasy. We are about theatre, acting and improvising. It is a perfect place to forget the 'real' world in exchange for fun, inspiration and happy improvisation feelings. <br></p>
<p>Malmö Improvisatorium is a very lively place:</p>
<p>-We always welcome you to our cozy universe of improvisation theatre.&nbsp;All that we ask is that you come with a positive attitude, a willingness to say yes, and explore a bit of social discomfort...Think of it like a runner's high, actually pretty awesome if you ask us! <br></p>
<p>-At some point you may discover that you actually may want to become a good improviser. Coincidentally, we have a regular group of highly skilled and amazing improv artists. And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>

<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

This is an active networking group for A variety of artists, from fine artists to jewelry designers, photographers, videographers, performance artists, tattoo artists, painters and 3D artists. The Meetup sessions might involve life drawing sessions, gallery visits, workshops or group meetings for critiques (if wanted), brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas or just sitting around talking about art or art events. Networking, giving each other advice, tutoring, workshops and a helping hand with promoting each other and cross-promoting is what this community should be about.</p> 
<p>We encourage all members to share opportunities, techniques and information that might be helpful for an artistic career or hobby. It is also a great way to make friends with some similar interests!</p> 
<p>The organizer of the group is Erika Stanley. Erika has been making a living from her art for over 25 years. She is a photographer (32 years), artist (35 years) and tattoo artist (23 years) who also founded and still runs a thriving tattoo studio in the Los Angeles area for the past 21 years (www.artandsoultattoos.com) she is currently in process of expanding her tattoo studio by opening a location one block away from Frederiksberg Metro and shopping center which includes a gallery to help local Copenhagen artists exhibit and sell their art (follow on Instagram @artandsoulgallery.dk or artandsoultattoos.dk or @erikafromamericatattoos) She really believes that for artists, art comes from the soul and is almost necessary for some souls to survive.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>
<p>Join us and a excitiiiiing new world will open up for you!!!</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1502637239000,"<p>This group wants to propose a series of games and exercises to create a nice evening of exploration and discovery by the hand of Theater.</p>
<p>Acting is playing. Playing is joy. Joy is freedom. Freedom is being unblocked.</p> 
<p>The only barrier between the actor and the expression is the blocks that he has.</p> 
<p>Free expression, which means in this case, playful expression is the base for acting. The rest is practice, technic, and each ones resources and interests.</p> 
<p>Being free of blocks is being free of acting or thinking through the mind. We want people to realize that to follow the body impulses and not the mind impulses (thoughts) free the actor from blocks. In this workshop, I will propose many different exercises, games and improvisations that will give a chance to the actors to realize this for themselves. By making mistakes and failing in the desire of expressing something to the audience, the actor realizes that the only intelligence that can help in this purpose comes from the body (intuitive) and not from the intellect. </p> 
<p>If you ask the mind, how does the “blue” color moves?, or if you ask the mind to move like Picasso’s Guernica, the mind will block itself, or will come out with a very intellectual, and “cold” approach which is not interesting for Theater.</p> 
<p>Now, if you ask the body, or I should say, if you let the body with its imagination explore into this question, it will come out with an expression that will be different in everyone of us and that cannot be evaluated into good or bad (as it is its own exploration). This expression will be interesting for the audience (in this case the rest of actors in the workshop). Because it comes out of a common place everyone will connect in some way or the other with it. Now this exploration can only be done out of joy and playfulness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could divide the evening in to 3 different sections:</p>
<p>Awareness and awakening of the senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration of the imagination of the body</p>
<p><span>Play: Scenes, improvisation, sketches, comic numbers</span><br></p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1232110995000,"<p>A very warm welcome to the Copenhagen Theatre Circle (CTC) Meetup Group! The CTC is an English-language amateur theatre company that has been performing high-quality theatre in Copenhagen since 1968. We usually put on three full-scale shows each year, in the spring, autumn and winter (the winter production being a British pantomime). We hold open auditions for our shows, which means that anyone is free to audition. Apart from actors, our membership includes directors, stage managers, designers, technicians, costume people, set builders, PR people and a myriad of others who make our shows work.</p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to become a CTC member and join us in one or more of these activities then please go to our website at <em><a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a></em> and click on ”Get Involved” in the top menu.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Besides our regular Meetups, we encourage our members to be creative and come with their own project proposals. These can take any form as long as it has something to do with the performing arts. So, for example, if you’re burning to perform that play you’ve just written, put together a project and we’ll most likely support you! Don't be shy! Come along and have some fun. You'll meet great people and who knows, you might just find yourself under the bright lights one day ... <br></span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to keep an eye on what we're up to, either follow us here on Meet Up, keep an eye on our website (<a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a>), Like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)"">https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)</a> or even follow us on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)"">https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Or perhaps imagine yourself, a fully grown adult, being given a permission to act like a little kid again, when everything you create on stage is as real as the bright shiny red ball that someone now is bouncing on the floor as we speak&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>This is exactly how life goes here, at Malmö Improvisatorium! Silly laughs, enchanting improv games and a fantastic atmosphere are guaranteed to open up your endless flow of fantasy. We are about theatre, acting and improvising. It is a perfect place to forget the 'real' world in exchange for fun, inspiration and happy improvisation feelings. <br></p>
<p>Malmö Improvisatorium is a very lively place:</p>
<p>-We always welcome you to our cozy universe of improvisation theatre.&nbsp;All that we ask is that you come with a positive attitude, a willingness to say yes, and explore a bit of social discomfort...Think of it like a runner's high, actually pretty awesome if you ask us! <br></p>
<p>-At some point you may discover that you actually may want to become a good improviser. Coincidentally, we have a regular group of highly skilled and amazing improv artists. And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>

<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

The Meetup sessions might involve life drawing sessions, gallery visits, workshops or group meetings for critiques (if wanted), brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas or just sitting around talking about art or art events.

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>
<p>Join us and a excitiiiiing new world will open up for you!!!</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1502637239000,"<p>This group wants to propose a series of games and exercises to create a nice evening of exploration and discovery by the hand of Theater.</p>
<p>Acting is playing. Playing is joy. Joy is freedom. Freedom is being unblocked.</p> 
<p>The only barrier between the actor and the expression is the blocks that he has.</p> 
<p>Free expression, which means in this case, playful expression is the base for acting. The rest is practice, technic, and each ones resources and interests.</p> 
<p>Being free of blocks is being free of acting or thinking through the mind. We want people to realize that to follow the body impulses and not the mind impulses (thoughts) free the actor from blocks. In this workshop, I will propose many different exercises, games and improvisations that will give a chance to the actors to realize this for themselves. By making mistakes and failing in the desire of expressing something to the audience, the actor realizes that the only intelligence that can help in this purpose comes from the body (intuitive) and not from the intellect. </p> 
<p>If you ask the mind, how does the “blue” color moves?, or if you ask the mind to move like Picasso’s Guernica, the mind will block itself, or will come out with a very intellectual, and “cold” approach which is not interesting for Theater.</p> 
<p>Now, if you ask the body, or I should say, if you let the body with its imagination explore into this question, it will come out with an expression that will be different in everyone of us and that cannot be evaluated into good or bad (as it is its own exploration). This expression will be interesting for the audience (in this case the rest of actors in the workshop). Because it comes out of a common place everyone will connect in some way or the other with it. Now this exploration can only be done out of joy and playfulness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could divide the evening in to 3 different sections:</p>
<p>Awareness and awakening of the senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration of the imagination of the body</p>
<p><span>Play: Scenes, improvisation, sketches, comic numbers</span><br></p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

If you're interested in art, but don't always ""get it"" this group's aim is to contextualize an artwork, performance, or exhibition, through a shared moderated dialogue between members. As a community we may read a text together and discuss it before seeing an exhibition, we may attend a lecture, participate in a workshop, create an object together, any exercise that helps us to more fully appreciate and comprehend visual culture and interdisciplinary practice. We will normally have a ""Prep"" meetup and then an excursion to go see actual works. Suggestions are welcomed and different members could lead a project, there's no hierarchy.

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

The CTC is an English-language amateur theatre company that has been performing high-quality theatre in Copenhagen since 1968. We usually put on three full-scale shows each year, in the spring, autumn and winter (the winter production being a British pantomime). We hold open auditions for our shows, which means that anyone is free to audition. Apart from actors, our membership includes directors, stage managers, designers, technicians, costume people, set builders, PR people and a myriad of others who make our shows work.</p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to become a CTC member and join us in one or more of these activities then please go to our website at <em><a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a></em> and click on ”Get Involved” in the top menu.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Besides our regular Meetups, we encourage our members to be creative and come with their own project proposals. These can take any form as long as it has something to do with the performing arts. So, for example, if you’re burning to perform that play you’ve just written, put together a project and we’ll most likely support you! Don't be shy! Come along and have some fun. You'll meet great people and who knows, you might just find yourself under the bright lights one day ... <br></span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to keep an eye on what we're up to, either follow us here on Meet Up, keep an eye on our website (<a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a>), Like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)"">https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)</a> or even follow us on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)"">https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

This is an active networking group for A variety of artists, from fine artists to jewelry designers, photographers, videographers, performance artists, tattoo artists, painters and 3D artists. The Meetup sessions might involve life drawing sessions, gallery visits, workshops or group meetings for critiques (if wanted), brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas or just sitting around talking about art or art events. Networking, giving each other advice, tutoring, workshops and a helping hand with promoting each other and cross-promoting is what this community should be about.</p> 
<p>We encourage all members to share opportunities, techniques and information that might be helpful for an artistic career or hobby. It is also a great way to make friends with some similar interests!</p> 
<p>The organizer of the group is Erika Stanley. Erika has been making a living from her art for over 25 years. She is a photographer (32 years), artist (35 years) and tattoo artist (23 years) who also founded and still runs a thriving tattoo studio in the Los Angeles area for the past 21 years (www.artandsoultattoos.com) she is currently in process of expanding her tattoo studio by opening a location one block away from Frederiksberg Metro and shopping center which includes a gallery to help local Copenhagen artists exhibit and sell their art (follow on Instagram @artandsoulgallery.dk or artandsoultattoos.dk or @erikafromamericatattoos) She really believes that for artists, art comes from the soul and is almost necessary for some souls to survive.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1502637239000,"<p>This group wants to propose a series of games and exercises to create a nice evening of exploration and discovery by the hand of Theater.</p>
<p>Acting is playing. Playing is joy. Joy is freedom. Freedom is being unblocked.</p> 
<p>The only barrier between the actor and the expression is the blocks that he has.</p> 
<p>Free expression, which means in this case, playful expression is the base for acting. The rest is practice, technic, and each ones resources and interests.</p> 
<p>Being free of blocks is being free of acting or thinking through the mind. We want people to realize that to follow the body impulses and not the mind impulses (thoughts) free the actor from blocks. In this workshop, I will propose many different exercises, games and improvisations that will give a chance to the actors to realize this for themselves. By making mistakes and failing in the desire of expressing something to the audience, the actor realizes that the only intelligence that can help in this purpose comes from the body (intuitive) and not from the intellect. </p> 
<p>If you ask the mind, how does the “blue” color moves?, or if you ask the mind to move like Picasso’s Guernica, the mind will block itself, or will come out with a very intellectual, and “cold” approach which is not interesting for Theater.</p> 
<p>Now, if you ask the body, or I should say, if you let the body with its imagination explore into this question, it will come out with an expression that will be different in everyone of us and that cannot be evaluated into good or bad (as it is its own exploration). This expression will be interesting for the audience (in this case the rest of actors in the workshop). Because it comes out of a common place everyone will connect in some way or the other with it. Now this exploration can only be done out of joy and playfulness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could divide the evening in to 3 different sections:</p>
<p>Awareness and awakening of the senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration of the imagination of the body</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1426454172000,"<p>Have you ever imagined what would it be like to be completely uninhibited and freely create spontaneous drama and comedy... Or perhaps imagine yourself, a fully grown adult, being given a permission to act like a little kid again, when everything you create on stage is as real as the bright shiny red ball that someone now is bouncing on the floor as we speak&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>This is exactly how life goes here, at Malmö Improvisatorium! Silly laughs, enchanting improv games and a fantastic atmosphere are guaranteed to open up your endless flow of fantasy. We are about theatre, acting and improvising. It is a perfect place to forget the 'real' world in exchange for fun, inspiration and happy improvisation feelings. <br></p>
<p>Malmö Improvisatorium is a very lively place:</p>
<p>-We always welcome you to our cozy universe of improvisation theatre.&nbsp;All that we ask is that you come with a positive attitude, a willingness to say yes, and explore a bit of social discomfort...Think of it like a runner's high, actually pretty awesome if you ask us! <br></p>
<p>-At some point you may discover that you actually may want to become a good improviser. Coincidentally, we have a regular group of highly skilled and amazing improv artists. And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>
<p>Join us and a excitiiiiing new world will open up for you!!!</p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

The CTC is an English-language amateur theatre company that has been performing high-quality theatre in Copenhagen since 1968. We usually put on three full-scale shows each year, in the spring, autumn and winter (the winter production being a British pantomime). We hold open auditions for our shows, which means that anyone is free to audition. Apart from actors, our membership includes directors, stage managers, designers, technicians, costume people, set builders, PR people and a myriad of others who make our shows work.</p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to become a CTC member and join us in one or more of these activities then please go to our website at <em><a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a></em> and click on ”Get Involved” in the top menu.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Besides our regular Meetups, we encourage our members to be creative and come with their own project proposals. These can take any form as long as it has something to do with the performing arts. So, for example, if you’re burning to perform that play you’ve just written, put together a project and we’ll most likely support you! Don't be shy! Come along and have some fun. You'll meet great people and who knows, you might just find yourself under the bright lights one day ... <br></span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to keep an eye on what we're up to, either follow us here on Meet Up, keep an eye on our website (<a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a>), Like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)"">https://www.facebook.com/ctcircle/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)</a> or even follow us on Twitter (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)"">https://twitter.com/ctcircledk)</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>-At some point you may discover that you actually may want to become a good improviser. Coincidentally, we have a regular group of highly skilled and amazing improv artists. And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

This is an active networking group for A variety of artists, from fine artists to jewelry designers, photographers, videographers, performance artists, tattoo artists, painters and 3D artists. The Meetup sessions might involve life drawing sessions, gallery visits, workshops or group meetings for critiques (if wanted), brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas or just sitting around talking about art or art events. Networking, giving each other advice, tutoring, workshops and a helping hand with promoting each other and cross-promoting is what this community should be about.</p> 
<p>We encourage all members to share opportunities, techniques and information that might be helpful for an artistic career or hobby. It is also a great way to make friends with some similar interests!</p> 
<p>The organizer of the group is Erika Stanley. Erika has been making a living from her art for over 25 years. She is a photographer (32 years), artist (35 years) and tattoo artist (23 years) who also founded and still runs a thriving tattoo studio in the Los Angeles area for the past 21 years (www.artandsoultattoos.com) she is currently in process of expanding her tattoo studio by opening a location one block away from Frederiksberg Metro and shopping center which includes a gallery to help local Copenhagen artists exhibit and sell their art (follow on Instagram @artandsoulgallery.dk or artandsoultattoos.dk or @erikafromamericatattoos) She really believes that for artists, art comes from the soul and is almost necessary for some souls to survive.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>
<p>Join us and a excitiiiiing new world will open up for you!!!</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1502637239000,"<p>This group wants to propose a series of games and exercises to create a nice evening of exploration and discovery by the hand of Theater.</p>
<p>Acting is playing. Playing is joy. Joy is freedom. Freedom is being unblocked.</p> 
<p>The only barrier between the actor and the expression is the blocks that he has.</p> 
<p>Free expression, which means in this case, playful expression is the base for acting. The rest is practice, technic, and each ones resources and interests.</p> 
<p>Being free of blocks is being free of acting or thinking through the mind. We want people to realize that to follow the body impulses and not the mind impulses (thoughts) free the actor from blocks. In this workshop, I will propose many different exercises, games and improvisations that will give a chance to the actors to realize this for themselves. By making mistakes and failing in the desire of expressing something to the audience, the actor realizes that the only intelligence that can help in this purpose comes from the body (intuitive) and not from the intellect. </p> 
<p>If you ask the mind, how does the “blue” color moves?, or if you ask the mind to move like Picasso’s Guernica, the mind will block itself, or will come out with a very intellectual, and “cold” approach which is not interesting for Theater.</p> 
<p>Now, if you ask the body, or I should say, if you let the body with its imagination explore into this question, it will come out with an expression that will be different in everyone of us and that cannot be evaluated into good or bad (as it is its own exploration). This expression will be interesting for the audience (in this case the rest of actors in the workshop). Because it comes out of a common place everyone will connect in some way or the other with it. Now this exploration can only be done out of joy and playfulness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could divide the evening in to 3 different sections:</p>
<p>Awareness and awakening of the senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration of the imagination of the body</p>
<p><span>Play: Scenes, improvisation, sketches, comic numbers</span><br></p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1428591945000,"<p>The <strong>Stockholm Drawing Meetup</strong> is a group that has been up and running since April 2015 by <b>volunteers</b>, with the intention of meeting and getting creative together and socialize.</p>
<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1428591945000,"<p>The <strong>Stockholm Drawing Meetup</strong> is a group that has been up and running since April 2015 by <b>volunteers</b>, with the intention of meeting and getting creative together and socialize.</p>
<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

<p>The Stockholm Drawing Meetup’s <strong>core goal</strong> is to <strong>organize art related and fun activities by promoting the cooperation and collaborative work, while keeping in mind constantly the human aspects and needs</strong>.</p>
<p>If you like to draw, paint, sketch, etc. or have done so in the past and would like to share the experience in a meetup-setup and have fun at the same time, this group is for you.</p>
<p>This applies to pencil/coal, water color or acrylic/oil or any other medium.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a professional to join but you must have an interest in creating art. </p>
<p>Our members have different concepts of art and participate with different goals. There are members of all the levels, from very beginners, hobbyists to professionals. </p>
<p>In general it is up to you which technique/s or medium to use at every activity.</p>
<p>If you would like to send a particular suggestion for activities or you desire to host an event, don't hesitate to contact any of the co-organizers.</p>
<p>As the group has grown up to reach almost 900 members, from different cultures and backgrounds, it has been considered the need to set up some rules, so that the organization becomes easier and everyone that wants to participate can do it freely, safe and comfortably. </p>
<p>Please read carefully our organization <strong>policy</strong> and its updatings sited at the forum, and make sure this is something you are prepared to abide:</p>

If you're interested in art, but don't always ""get it"" this group's aim is to contextualize an artwork, performance, or exhibition, through a shared moderated dialogue between members. As a community we may read a text together and discuss it before seeing an exhibition, we may attend a lecture, participate in a workshop, create an object together, any exercise that helps us to more fully appreciate and comprehend visual culture and interdisciplinary practice. We will normally have a ""Prep"" meetup and then an excursion to go see actual works. Suggestions are welcomed and different members could lead a project, there's no hierarchy. We won't act as museum tour guides or educators, this is a participatory network.</p>",,,,,,,21505933,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/AW-Reading-Group-The-Unseen-By-Nanni-Balestrini/,18.06999969482422,504,Visual Culture,12198614,Candace A.

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Stockholm,SE,1508239126000,"<p>Do you find it challenging to speak Swedish outside of class? Would you like to practice your Swedish in a friendly and safe environment? Are you curious to try a new and fun way of learning? Then this is the workshop for you!</p> 
<p>Research shows that laughing makes it easier to learn and remember new information, and one of our favourite ways to laugh is improvised theatre (improv). That is why we have created this group; to provide an opportunity for you to practice your Swedish outside of class, in a new and unconventional way that involves lots of laughing. </p> 
<p>Together, we will do different improv games and exercises, in simple Swedish, allowing you to use your current vocabulary as well as expand it further. One of the bases of improv is to ”celebrate your failures” which means that the classes will allow you to make mistakes in a safe environment, so that it’s easier to relax while strengthening your Swedish language muscles!</p> 
<p>For those who attend the drop-ins, we would also like to give you the chance to see an improv show and therefore give you a free ticket to one of our ”Improkavalkad” shows in January, played in Swedish.&nbsp; There will also be occasions when we go out for drinks together after class.</p> 
<p>Cost for drop- in classes in January and first class in February: FREE</p> 
<p>Mid-February we will start with a class that extends over 6 weeks where we will have themed classes focusing on different specific areas and exercises each week. Examples of themes are: characters, storytelling and being a good listener.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>You do <b>not </b>need any previous theatre or improv experience, <b>however</b> a basic level of understanding and speaking Swedish is required.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1232110995000,"<p>A very warm welcome to the Copenhagen Theatre Circle (CTC) Meetup Group! The CTC is an English-language amateur theatre company that has been performing high-quality theatre in Copenhagen since 1968. We usually put on three full-scale shows each year, in the spring, autumn and winter (the winter production being a British pantomime). We hold open auditions for our shows, which means that anyone is free to audition. Apart from actors, our membership includes directors, stage managers, designers, technicians, costume people, set builders, PR people and a myriad of others who make our shows work.</p>
<p><span><strong>If you want to become a CTC member and join us in one or more of these activities then please go to our website at <em><a href=""http://www.ctcircle.dk"">www.ctcircle.dk</a></em> and click on ”Get Involved” in the top menu.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Besides our regular Meetups, we encourage our members to be creative and come with their own project proposals. These can take any form as long as it has something to do with the performing arts. So, for example, if you’re burning to perform that play you’ve just written, put together a project and we’ll most likely support you! Don't be shy! Come along and have some fun. You'll meet great people and who knows, you might just find yourself under the bright lights one day ... <br></span></p>

Or perhaps imagine yourself, a fully grown adult, being given a permission to act like a little kid again, when everything you create on stage is as real as the bright shiny red ball that someone now is bouncing on the floor as we speak&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>This is exactly how life goes here, at Malmö Improvisatorium! Silly laughs, enchanting improv games and a fantastic atmosphere are guaranteed to open up your endless flow of fantasy. We are about theatre, acting and improvising. It is a perfect place to forget the 'real' world in exchange for fun, inspiration and happy improvisation feelings. <br></p>
<p>Malmö Improvisatorium is a very lively place:</p>
<p>-We always welcome you to our cozy universe of improvisation theatre.&nbsp;All that we ask is that you come with a positive attitude, a willingness to say yes, and explore a bit of social discomfort...Think of it like a runner's high, actually pretty awesome if you ask us! <br></p>
<p>-At some point you may discover that you actually may want to become a good improviser. Coincidentally, we have a regular group of highly skilled and amazing improv artists. And you are welcome to join this infinite fun! By the way, we pay a great deal of attention to the skills we wish to develop as a group. If you are already an experienced improviser, this is probably a great place ;) <br></p>
<p>-We like to perform in public and you may see us sometimes on stage, or performing in a bar, or maybe even in the street or on the beach. We prove over and over that everyone has a talent to improvise and even if you have never improvised before, who knows, maybe one day you will find yourself on stage. Sometimes we have dedicated series of classes intended for the performing improvisers. <br></p>
<p>-We also like to shoot short movies. We do it in a fruitful collaboration with a talented film director. We have proved a simple formula, which goes as Improvisers+Camera+Enthusiasm=Fun, Beauty and many other miracles. <br></p>
<br>
<p>There are some guidelines to make improv a fun and rewarding experience for every player involved. They are well summarised in 13 ""maxims"" (rules) of improv:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Say yes</p>
<p>2. Don't prepare</p>
<p>3. Just show up</p>
<p>4. Start anywhere</p>
<p>5. Be average</p>
<p>6. Pay attention</p>
<p>7. Face the facts</p>
<p>8. Stay on course</p>
<p>9. Wake up to the gifts</p>
<p>10. Make mistakes, please</p>
<p>11. Act now</p>
<p>12. Take care of each other</p>
<p>13. Enjoy the ride</p>
<p>(from the book ""Improv Wisdom"" by Patricia Ryan Madsen) <br> </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>In addition, to make this a happy constructive experience:</p>
<p>1. Be safe</p>
<p>2. Be nice&nbsp;</p>

This is an active networking group for A variety of artists, from fine artists to jewelry designers, photographers, videographers, performance artists, tattoo artists, painters and 3D artists. The Meetup sessions might involve life drawing sessions, gallery visits, workshops or group meetings for critiques (if wanted), brainstorming sessions and sharing of ideas or just sitting around talking about art or art events. Networking, giving each other advice, tutoring, workshops and a helping hand with promoting each other and cross-promoting is what this community should be about.</p> 
<p>We encourage all members to share opportunities, techniques and information that might be helpful for an artistic career or hobby. It is also a great way to make friends with some similar interests!</p> 
<p>The organizer of the group is Erika Stanley. Erika has been making a living from her art for over 25 years. She is a photographer (32 years), artist (35 years) and tattoo artist (23 years) who also founded and still runs a thriving tattoo studio in the Los Angeles area for the past 21 years (www.artandsoultattoos.com) she is currently in process of expanding her tattoo studio by opening a location one block away from Frederiksberg Metro and shopping center which includes a gallery to help local Copenhagen artists exhibit and sell their art (follow on Instagram @artandsoulgallery.dk or artandsoultattoos.dk or @erikafromamericatattoos) She really believes that for artists, art comes from the soul and is almost necessary for some souls to survive.</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Malmö,SE,1498572002000,"<p>Malmö's International Improv Players (MIIP) is now finally on Meetup...</p>
<p>Welcome to the colorful and fun world of Improv!</p>
<p>Improv (also known as Improvisational theatre or Impro) is the art of playing different games in the moment, without preparations or script. The improvisers are acting, directing themselves, writing the plot and interacting with each other all at the same time without previous planning. It is all about being positive and having plenty of&nbsp;fun together!</p>
<p>Improv offers a chance to relax, really be yourself, bring out your inner child&nbsp;and drop your defenses in a safe and positive enviromement. We, kind of&nbsp;improvise all the time in real life, we don't plan every conversation and interaction that is going to happen to us during the day. Many of the best bits of life are totaly spontaneous, and this is what we try to recreate&nbsp;in a more creative way in Improv.</p>
<p>Improv also improves intuition, trains creativity and teamwork, gives more confidence in all sorts of social situations. Improv helps even with business skills by training your mind to think quickly and react to unexpected situations. Can you believe that?!</p>
<p>We are a group of positive, laugh-loving and open-minded improv addicts from all around the world. We have been meeting for couple of years now, twice a week in central Malmö. We often invite professional improvisers or experienced improv-friends in order to develop our skills. Once in a while we give performances in cooperation with MAF (Malmö Amatörteater Forum). We are always open for new ideas and new enthusiastic improvisers. </p>
<p>Join us and a excitiiiiing new world will open up for you!!!</p>

1,fine arts/culture,arts-culture,Copenhagen,DK,1502637239000,"<p>This group wants to propose a series of games and exercises to create a nice evening of exploration and discovery by the hand of Theater.</p>
<p>Acting is playing. Playing is joy. Joy is freedom. Freedom is being unblocked.</p> 
<p>The only barrier between the actor and the expression is the blocks that he has.</p> 
<p>Free expression, which means in this case, playful expression is the base for acting. The rest is practice, technic, and each ones resources and interests.</p> 
<p>Being free of blocks is being free of acting or thinking through the mind. We want people to realize that to follow the body impulses and not the mind impulses (thoughts) free the actor from blocks. In this workshop, I will propose many different exercises, games and improvisations that will give a chance to the actors to realize this for themselves. By making mistakes and failing in the desire of expressing something to the audience, the actor realizes that the only intelligence that can help in this purpose comes from the body (intuitive) and not from the intellect. </p> 
<p>If you ask the mind, how does the “blue” color moves?, or if you ask the mind to move like Picasso’s Guernica, the mind will block itself, or will come out with a very intellectual, and “cold” approach which is not interesting for Theater.</p> 
<p>Now, if you ask the body, or I should say, if you let the body with its imagination explore into this question, it will come out with an expression that will be different in everyone of us and that cannot be evaluated into good or bad (as it is its own exploration). This expression will be interesting for the audience (in this case the rest of actors in the workshop). Because it comes out of a common place everyone will connect in some way or the other with it. Now this exploration can only be done out of joy and playfulness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could divide the evening in to 3 different sections:</p>
<p>Awareness and awakening of the senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration of the imagination of the body</p>
<p><span>Play: Scenes, improvisation, sketches, comic numbers</span><br></p>
