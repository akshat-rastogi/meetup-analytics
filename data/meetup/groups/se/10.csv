Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge.

However, the purpose of the group is for vegans to meet like-minded people and all meetup events are to be fully vegan.</p>
<p>A vegan&nbsp;avoids the consumption of animal products, hence a vegan diet is characterized by being a plant-based diet containing no animal products, i.e. no meat, no fish, no egg, no dairy products, and no honey.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for adopting a vegan lifestyle. In the video clip below Gary Yourofsky explains why you should become a vegan. He is very entertaining and it is really worth watching.</p>

However, the purpose of the group is for vegans to meet like-minded people and all meetup events are to be fully vegan.</p>
<p>A vegan&nbsp;avoids the consumption of animal products, hence a vegan diet is characterized by being a plant-based diet containing no animal products, i.e. no meat, no fish, no egg, no dairy products, and no honey.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for adopting a vegan lifestyle. In the video clip below Gary Yourofsky explains why you should become a vegan. He is very entertaining and it is really worth watching.</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1503916716000,"<p>I am passionate about cooking and used to organize such events in Austria. Now, as I am moving to Stockholm, I would like to do the same here. Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1414070958000,"<p>Are you new in town and looking to get to know some people in the city who you can try that great new restaurant with or simply a glass of wine after work? This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event! Happy dining / drinking / chatting!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

<p>It doesn't matter on which level you are in your cooking knowledge or which budget you have. This group is for everyone that wants to shape up their daily cooking, eat less take away/ready to eat dishes and learn how to transform the food available at home. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>By lectures, workshops and by inviting people with different expertise in the food area we will get you inspired in your cooking. To bring enthusiasm and inspiration to everyone attending we need the meet ups to be dynamic. Therefore we encourage our members to be active in discussions and share their own tips with the rest of the group. Or why not host your own meetup here!?</p> 
<p>Behind the group is Kalle Söderman. Kalle offers an online service with IngredientMatcher, that shows you new recipes you can make with the ingredients you already have at home!</p>

<p>We'll be getting together for brunches and dinners that include everything from cheap eats to five star restaurants. We will also try to make social group deals/discount for our food and dinning group and we will announce them in a timely manner.<br>

If we are eating at a restaurant where booking a table is needed, the organizer has to plan and book it.<br>

<br>

-Only RSVP if you are 100% sure you can come. If you change your RSVP from ""Yes"" to ""No"" two times within a short period for different meetups you cannot be a member of the group. So please only choose ""yes"" if you are sure you can come. <br>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at.

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

Does the idea of making new friends and having great conversations appeal to you? If you've answered yes to any of the above, then join us as we eat our way through Stockholm! </p>
<p>We'll be getting together for brunches and dinners that include everything from cheap eats to five star restaurants. We will also try to make social group deals/discount for our food and dinning group and we will announce them in a timely manner.<br>

<br>

<b>Please Note:</b><br>

If we are eating at a restaurant where booking a table is needed, the organizer has to plan and book it.<br>

<br>

<b>Therefore we have two rules:</b><br>

-Only RSVP if you are 100% sure you can come. If you change your RSVP from ""Yes"" to ""No"" two times within a short period for different meetups you cannot be a member of the group. So please only choose ""yes"" if you are sure you can come. <br>

-If you RSVP ""Yes"" and then don't come the meetup, same thing applies - you cannot be a member of the group.<br>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at.

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

However, the purpose of the group is for vegans to meet like-minded people and all meetup events are to be fully vegan.</p>
<p>A vegan&nbsp;avoids the consumption of animal products, hence a vegan diet is characterized by being a plant-based diet containing no animal products, i.e. no meat, no fish, no egg, no dairy products, and no honey.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for adopting a vegan lifestyle. In the video clip below Gary Yourofsky explains why you should become a vegan. He is very entertaining and it is really worth watching.</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1503916716000,"<p>I am passionate about cooking and used to organize such events in Austria. Now, as I am moving to Stockholm, I would like to do the same here. Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

The unifying theme for the meetup events is vegan food and lifestyle, but you don't have to be vegan to join this group and attend the events. However, the purpose of the group is for vegans to meet like-minded people and all meetup events are to be fully vegan.</p>
<p>A vegan&nbsp;avoids the consumption of animal products, hence a vegan diet is characterized by being a plant-based diet containing no animal products, i.e. no meat, no fish, no egg, no dairy products, and no honey.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for adopting a vegan lifestyle. In the video clip below Gary Yourofsky explains why you should become a vegan. He is very entertaining and it is really worth watching.</p>

<p>You can also become vegan for a better health. See Michael Greger's annual talk about how you can avoid the most common diseases with a vegan diet:</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

<p>Behind the group is Kalle Söderman. Kalle offers an online service with IngredientMatcher, that shows you new recipes you can make with the ingredients you already have at home!</p>

Does the idea of making new friends and having great conversations appeal to you? If you've answered yes to any of the above, then join us as we eat our way through Stockholm! </p>
<p>We'll be getting together for brunches and dinners that include everything from cheap eats to five star restaurants. We will also try to make social group deals/discount for our food and dinning group and we will announce them in a timely manner.<br>

<br>

<b>Please Note:</b><br>

If we are eating at a restaurant where booking a table is needed, the organizer has to plan and book it.<br>

<br>

<b>Therefore we have two rules:</b><br>

-Only RSVP if you are 100% sure you can come. If you change your RSVP from ""Yes"" to ""No"" two times within a short period for different meetups you cannot be a member of the group. So please only choose ""yes"" if you are sure you can come. <br>

-If you RSVP ""Yes"" and then don't come the meetup, same thing applies - you cannot be a member of the group.<br>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at.

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>

<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event! Happy dining / drinking / chatting!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1503916716000,"<p>I am passionate about cooking and used to organize such events in Austria. Now, as I am moving to Stockholm, I would like to do the same here. Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

<p>It doesn't matter on which level you are in your cooking knowledge or which budget you have. This group is for everyone that wants to shape up their daily cooking, eat less take away/ready to eat dishes and learn how to transform the food available at home. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>By lectures, workshops and by inviting people with different expertise in the food area we will get you inspired in your cooking. To bring enthusiasm and inspiration to everyone attending we need the meet ups to be dynamic. Therefore we encourage our members to be active in discussions and share their own tips with the rest of the group. Or why not host your own meetup here!?</p> 
<p>Behind the group is Kalle Söderman. Kalle offers an online service with IngredientMatcher, that shows you new recipes you can make with the ingredients you already have at home!</p>

-Only RSVP if you are 100% sure you can come. If you change your RSVP from ""Yes"" to ""No"" two times within a short period for different meetups you cannot be a member of the group. So please only choose ""yes"" if you are sure you can come. <br>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at.

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts.

<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at. Where we would meet depends completely on the number of people who would like to join in, perhaps we can find a suitable local as this meet up takes form.</p>",,,,,,,13458182,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Cookie-Swap/,18.06999969482422,49,Stockholm Cookie Swap,58088342,Lina Conde,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,,91943462.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/a/6/member_91943462.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/a/6/thumb_91943462.jpeg,member,4.94,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'dessert', 'name': 'Dessert', 'id': 10439}, {'urlkey': 'baking', 'name': 'Baking', 'id': 15718}, {'urlkey': 'cupcakes', 'name': 'Cupcakes', 'id': 19521}, {'urlkey': 'cookies', 'name': 'Cookies', 'id': 21402}, {'urlkey': 'cookie-swap', 'name': 'Cookie Swap', 'id': 29726}, {'urlkey': 'cookie-decorating', 'name': 'Cookie Decorating', 'id': 38496}, {'urlkey': 'cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking', 'name': 'Cooking', 'id': 43256}, {'urlkey': 'cake-dessert-lovers', 'name': 'Cake & Dessert Lovers', 'id': 48241}, {'urlkey': 'people-who-love-to-bake-cakes', 'name': 'People who Love to Bake Cakes', 'id': 85183}, {'urlkey': 'people-who-like-shaing-baking-tips-and-recipes', 'name': 'People who like shaing Baking Tips and Recipes', 'id': 85185}, {'urlkey': 'baking-from-scratch', 'name': 'Baking from scratch', 'id': 168981}]",Stockholm-Cookie-Swap,3600000,public,Cookie bakers

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts. And then sometimes it's just nice to be around like-minded people who appreciate the conscious choices we make as part of our lifestyle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>OUR NEW NO-SHOW POLICY</b><br> <br> Dear vegans,</p> 
<p>Since some meetups require proper planning and booking of specific venues in advance, we have decided to create these new rules, to help us in organizing the meetups better.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1503916716000,"<p>I am passionate about cooking and used to organize such events in Austria. Now, as I am moving to Stockholm, I would like to do the same here. Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

<p>It doesn't matter on which level you are in your cooking knowledge or which budget you have. This group is for everyone that wants to shape up their daily cooking, eat less take away/ready to eat dishes and learn how to transform the food available at home. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>By lectures, workshops and by inviting people with different expertise in the food area we will get you inspired in your cooking. To bring enthusiasm and inspiration to everyone attending we need the meet ups to be dynamic. Therefore we encourage our members to be active in discussions and share their own tips with the rest of the group. Or why not host your own meetup here!?</p> 
<p>Behind the group is Kalle Söderman. Kalle offers an online service with IngredientMatcher, that shows you new recipes you can make with the ingredients you already have at home!</p>

So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at.

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

Lets make life easier for ourselves, show others how simple it can be and encourage the spread of veganism in a non-militant way. We are all humans here: sometimes it is not always possible to be strictly vegan, sometimes people don't understand and sometimes life just gets in the way of our best efforts.

<p>We encourage everyone to be mindful of others and update your RSVPs as early as possible, since we have a waiting list most of the time.</p> 
<p>- 3 (three) <b>No-Shows</b> or <b>Late Cancellations</b> will result in your removal from the group.</p> 
<p>- each member that RSVP and did not show-up will receive an email or message reminding them about our new policy and that they have a warning.</p> 
<p>- Cancellations less than 12 hours before an event start time are considered <b>""Late Cancellations""</b> and may count as a <b>No Show</b>.<br> <br><b> **Your Event Host may lengthen or shorten this time frame depending on the venue, etc. but we all strive to be as fair and flexible as possible.</b><br> <br> Thanking you in advance,</p>

Unfortunately I rarely have an occasion to make the extra effort with my baking, other than perhaps for birthdays and holidays. Exploring and developing new recipes is fun, but in the end it is only me or my family eating my baked goods and we all know what too many cookies does to you! So I have an idea of a having a cookie recipe swap every now and then! People with a baking interest will meet, taste and give feedback on each others cookies and of course share the recipe with each other. You can use your favourite classic recipe, the old family recipe, search the internet for a new or if you feel creative, make a new recipe! Each meet up should have a theme, like chocolate, nuts, non bake, sponge cake, candy... well I think you know what Im getting at. Where we would meet depends completely on the number of people who would like to join in, perhaps we can find a suitable local as this meet up takes form.</p>",,,,,,,13458182,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Cookie-Swap/,18.06999969482422,49,Stockholm Cookie Swap,58088342,Lina Conde,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,,91943462.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/a/6/member_91943462.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/a/6/thumb_91943462.jpeg,member,4.94,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'dessert', 'name': 'Dessert', 'id': 10439}, {'urlkey': 'baking', 'name': 'Baking', 'id': 15718}, {'urlkey': 'cupcakes', 'name': 'Cupcakes', 'id': 19521}, {'urlkey': 'cookies', 'name': 'Cookies', 'id': 21402}, {'urlkey': 'cookie-swap', 'name': 'Cookie Swap', 'id': 29726}, {'urlkey': 'cookie-decorating', 'name': 'Cookie Decorating', 'id': 38496}, {'urlkey': 'cooking-any-and-all-kinds-of-cooking', 'name': 'Cooking', 'id': 43256}, {'urlkey': 'cake-dessert-lovers', 'name': 'Cake & Dessert Lovers', 'id': 48241}, {'urlkey': 'people-who-love-to-bake-cakes', 'name': 'People who Love to Bake Cakes', 'id': 85183}, {'urlkey': 'people-who-like-shaing-baking-tips-and-recipes', 'name': 'People who like shaing Baking Tips and Recipes', 'id': 85185}, {'urlkey': 'baking-from-scratch', 'name': 'Baking from scratch', 'id': 168981}]",Stockholm-Cookie-Swap,3600000,public,Cookie bakers

This is a group for people who enjoy going to restaurants and bars, but would prefer the event wasn't completely centered around the food and drinks themselves. It's a group for anyone and everyone who is passionate about something and ready to put themselves out there to meet new people and try new places. Event sizes will be kept intimate but frequent, as the main purpose here is that we can get to know each other and form genuine friendships with those who are part of the group (while of course trying out a whole lot of great food, wine and beer along the way!) Some similar groups tend to have a lot of people attending the events, which can make it a little difficult to get to know each other, and can be a little overwhelming for some. I will be trying to keep dinner groups to 8, but will extend to 10 for events with a high interest. I will post events frequently though so everyone can have a chance to join! If the group grows, we can re-evaluate. I highly encourage any members to add their own events to this group as well. Heard of a great bar and want to check it out on a Friday? Post an event!

10,food/drink,food-drink,Stockholm,SE,1440610075000,"<p>This is a group for all people interested in wine and wine tasting. We will arrange tastings for small groups where each of us will bring a bottle, give a short presentation and taste it. We will meet in the apartment of one of the two organizers who will kindly share his kitchen and glasses for the love of wine. We will have a theme for each occasion to give the selection a context. Everyone is welcome to join in regardless of your level of knowledge or age. The purpose is to create a fun and inclusive social space for people to meet and learn about wine. My co-organizer and I came up with the idea to create this group after recently having moved back to Sweden. Where I previously lived I used to gather with wine loving friends where each of us would bring a bottle and cook something, or meet up in a BYOB restaurant. This was a great way to get to taste many different wines and more importantly, to enjoy wine the way it is meant to - in the company of other people. If you are all alone it will cost you a lot to cork up six bottles and perhaps even make you feel miserable, but if we do it together, we will have a nice time and probably also lots of fun. About myself: I am half Japanese half Swedish and have spent almost half of my life in both countries. I was recently working with French wine for an importer in Tokyo where I had the opportunity to experience many mind-blowing wines, as well as amazing people who have devoted their lives to the spread of high quality drinks. I am educated in two different wine schools where I have studied for JSA Wine expert, WSET level three, SSI Sake Sommelier, and I am currently enrolled in an online course for the WSET Diploma. I enjoy all sorts of wine, but I tend to be most interested in wines with personality, representing either history, typicity or the personality of the wine maker. In tastings however, I like to encounter everything from large-scale productions to the work of small boutique wineries of all corners of the world. There’s a jungle of wine out there so let’s get together and explore it!</p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/highres_451806476.jpeg,451806476.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/600_451806476.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/4/c/thumb_451806476.jpeg,event,18870946,open,59.33000183105469,https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Wine-Tasters/,18.06999969482422,210,Stockholm Wine Tasters,186955991,Dan Fukushima,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/highres_249163394.jpeg,249163394.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/member_249163394.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/9/8/2/thumb_249163394.jpeg,member,4.86,Europe/Stockholm,"[{'urlkey': 'wine', 'name': 'Wine', 'id': 611}, {'urlkey': 'diningout', 'name': 'Dining Out', 'id': 713}, {'urlkey': 'socialnetwork', 'name': 'Social Networking', 'id': 4422}, {'urlkey': 'wine-tasting', 'name': 'Wine Tasting', 'id': 15139}, {'urlkey': 'wine-lovers', 'name': 'Wine Lovers', 'id': 15634}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-food-pairing', 'name': 'Wine and Food Pairing', 'id': 15635}, {'urlkey': 'wine-and-cheese', 'name': 'Wine and Cheese', 'id': 17108}, {'urlkey': 'wine-winetasting-wine-and-food-pairing-winelovers', 'name': 'Wine,WineTasting,Wine and Food Pairing,WineLovers', 'id': 18189}, {'urlkey': 'wine-education', 'name': 'Wine Education', 'id': 18773}, {'urlkey': 'eating-drinking-talking-laughing-etc', 'name': 'Eating, Drinking, Talking, Laughing, Etc', 'id': 19130}]",Stockholm-Wine-Tasters,3600000,public_limited,Friendly wine tasters

Usually it is somewhat of a casual fine dining event and the purpose of it all is to get to know new people and bring people together. It also gives me the opportunity to practice my cooking and improve. The dinner - usually 5 courses with drink accompaniment - will be offered at face value i.e. all I do is cover my costs, so I don’t earn anything. What I do get is new experience and knowledge. The menu and price will be published in advance and the number of people able to join will always be limited to 6. Hope to see you soon!</p>

The unifying theme for the meetup events is vegan food and lifestyle, but you don't have to be vegan to join this group and attend the events. However, the purpose of the group is for vegans to meet like-minded people and all meetup events are to be fully vegan.</p>
<p>A vegan&nbsp;avoids the consumption of animal products, hence a vegan diet is characterized by being a plant-based diet containing no animal products, i.e. no meat, no fish, no egg, no dairy products, and no honey.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for adopting a vegan lifestyle. In the video clip below Gary Yourofsky explains why you should become a vegan. He is very entertaining and it is really worth watching.</p>

<p>You can also become vegan for a better health. See Michael Greger's annual talk about how you can avoid the most common diseases with a vegan diet:</p>
