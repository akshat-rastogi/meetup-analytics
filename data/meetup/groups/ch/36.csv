<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>L'objectif de ce groupe est de réunir des gens de tous horizons ayant tous un désir ou un besoin de changement dans leur vie, ainsi qu'une réelle volonté de passer à l'action! On est souvent bien dans seul face au changement, ce qui rend difficile de respecter ses engagements personnels et qui finit par nous faire laisser tomber... <br>L'idée ici est donc de trouver des personnes dans la même situation pour se motiver les uns les autres et pour que chacun atteignent ses objectifs! On est toujours plus efficace quand on sait que quelque part, quelqu'un compte sur nous pour y arriver! <br>J'aimerais également en profiter pour partager mon expérience en tant que Coach en Développement Personnel et vous faire découvrir certaines clés, certaines méthodes pour vous aider à <i>Simplifier votre vie!</i></p>

We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres

36,writing,writing,Bern,CH,1521845688000,"<p>Shut Up &amp; Write!™ is more than a movement, more than a good idea. We’re a method of writing that delivers. As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

36,writing,writing,Bern,CH,1521845688000,"<p>Shut Up &amp; Write!™ is more than a movement, more than a good idea. We’re a method of writing that delivers. As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises.

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>

36,writing,writing,Zürich,CH,1476908962000,"<p>Zurich Storytellers is a meetup of people who want to learn (more) how to craft good stories and an opportunity to practice telling them in a supportive friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

36,writing,writing,Zürich,CH,1476908962000,"<p>Zurich Storytellers is a meetup of people who want to learn (more) how to craft good stories and an opportunity to practice telling them in a supportive friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>L'objectif de ce groupe est de réunir des gens de tous horizons ayant tous un désir ou un besoin de changement dans leur vie, ainsi qu'une réelle volonté de passer à l'action! On est souvent bien dans seul face au changement, ce qui rend difficile de respecter ses engagements personnels et qui finit par nous faire laisser tomber... <br>L'idée ici est donc de trouver des personnes dans la même situation pour se motiver les uns les autres et pour que chacun atteignent ses objectifs!

We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony.

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres

36,writing,writing,Bern,CH,1521845688000,"<p>Shut Up &amp; Write!™ is more than a movement, more than a good idea. We’re a method of writing that delivers. As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony.

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>L'objectif de ce groupe est de réunir des gens de tous horizons ayant tous un désir ou un besoin de changement dans leur vie, ainsi qu'une réelle volonté de passer à l'action! On est souvent bien dans seul face au changement, ce qui rend difficile de respecter ses engagements personnels et qui finit par nous faire laisser tomber... <br>L'idée ici est donc de trouver des personnes dans la même situation pour se motiver les uns les autres et pour que chacun atteignent ses objectifs!

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony.

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p> <br></p>
<p>L'objectif de ce groupe est de réunir des gens de tous horizons ayant tous un désir ou un besoin de changement dans leur vie, ainsi qu'une réelle volonté de passer à l'action! On est souvent bien dans seul face au changement, ce qui rend difficile de respecter ses engagements personnels et qui finit par nous faire laisser tomber... <br>L'idée ici est donc de trouver des personnes dans la même situation pour se motiver les uns les autres et pour que chacun atteignent ses objectifs! On est toujours plus efficace quand on sait que quelque part, quelqu'un compte sur nous pour y arriver! <br>J'aimerais également en profiter pour partager mon expérience en tant que Coach en Développement Personnel et vous faire découvrir certaines clés, certaines méthodes pour vous aider à <i>Simplifier votre vie!</i></p>

We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

36,writing,writing,Bern,CH,1521845688000,"<p>Shut Up &amp; Write!™ is more than a movement, more than a good idea. We’re a method of writing that delivers. As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

36,writing,writing,Zürich,CH,1476908962000,"<p>Zurich Storytellers is a meetup of people who want to learn (more) how to craft good stories and an opportunity to practice telling them in a supportive friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>

<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity.

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

36,writing,writing,Zürich,CH,1476908962000,"<p>Zurich Storytellers is a meetup of people who want to learn (more) how to craft good stories and an opportunity to practice telling them in a supportive friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>

<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

36,writing,writing,Zürich,CH,1476908962000,"<p>Zurich Storytellers is a meetup of people who want to learn (more) how to craft good stories and an opportunity to practice telling them in a supportive friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gain advice from experienced storytellers how to craft and tell your story in a compelling way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Our meetup's format varies but generally time is divided between learning/sharing techniques of crafting story and discussing the stories members tell at the meetup.&nbsp;<span>Member stories can be prepared in advance or improvised on the spot. <br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>

<p>Stories shape the way we perceive our own causes and whether others will care about them. By giving purpose to our actions, the stories we tell ourselves (and others) are at the core of our success – or lack of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>

<p><span>Here are 10 tips to help guide story design from beginning to end:</span></p>
<p><i>Hook us. Make us care about you. Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma. Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>

As an international organization, we are thousands of writers in a worldwide community, but most importantly, we are writers who write together in a local cafe. Join us. </p>
<p>We have events every week, all over. Sometimes we talk after. Whatever you’re writing, whatever form it takes, wherever you are in your process, you won’t be the only one. </p>
<p>And if you need help with your writing, we offer that too.
Want to know more? Check us out: www.shutupwrite.com. Or get in touch: <br>questions@shutupwrite.com. </p>
<p>Meetup Event Format
It is an empowering and rewarding experience to write an hour each week, at the same time and place. It serves as powerful support for building your daily writing discipline. </p>
<p>RSVP and please arrive 10–15 minutes early to get settled. At the Meetup our Organizer will lead introductions and then everyone will sit down and write. </p>
<p>Afterwards, feel free to get to know each other. Members often talk about their successes and challenges as writers. The Shut Up &amp; Write!™ format brings a social facet to a normally isolated craft. </p>
<p>Our Meetups are a safe space for writers to work on their craft. No one will read or critique your writing. </p>

<p>Benefits of writing:</p>
<p>- Writing -on your own or in a&nbsp;group-&nbsp;allows an exploration of&nbsp;ourselves and&nbsp;the world or any element of it through our lenses or the lenses of a fictional character! This is why it&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel like a magical activity.</p>
<p>- It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-expressive&nbsp;activity and a very powerful source of all healing and clarity.</p>
<p>- Even in a group, it is an introspective activity which can work like a meditation!</p>
<p>- If we give a go to reading aloud for the others some of&nbsp;what you wrote, without getting any feedback, it can be quite liberating.</p>
<p>- If you are&nbsp;extremely passionate about it, and you keep at it, you could get published!</p>
<p><img src=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/840875_pen_and_paper-150x150.jpg"" alt=""freewriting"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<p>“I still encourage anyone who feels at all compelled to <br> write to do so. I just try to warn people who hope to get published that <br> publication is not all that it is cracked up to be. But writing is. Writing has <br> so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to <br> force yourself to do – the actual act of writing – turns out to be the best <br> part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony <br> for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of <br> writing turns out to be its own reward.” <br> —Anne Lamott, from <em>Bird by Bird(</em>from <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>)</p>
<p>The language of this meet up group&nbsp;is English. We will do some writing exercises that might prove challenging but worth doing. I have several books on writing plus I'd like to do the exercises suggested by Jane Brunette in <a href=""http://writingfromthesoul.net/"">writingfromthesoul.net</a>.</p>
<p><span>This group has a mix and range of approaches and motivations for writing. Most of us are non-native English speakers. Obviously writing is predominantly a lone activity. In this group we make an exception and share. All you need is the willingness to write and an open mind. Please note: We don't come to correct or judge each other. If you wish to have feedback this can be organized.</span><br></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/highres_312588392.jpeg,312588392.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/600_312588392.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/0/8/thumb_312588392.jpeg,event,9628882,open,47.380001068115234,https://www.meetup.com/Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group/,8.539999961853027,65,Zurich and Thalwil Writing Group,54100712,Aaron Digulla,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/highres_61858832.jpeg,61858832,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/member_61858832.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/d/0/thumb_61858832.jpeg,member,4.91,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'journaling', 'name': 'Journaling', 'id': 6209}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing', 'name': 'Creative Writing', 'id': 15322}, {'urlkey': 'happiness', 'name': 'Happiness', 'id': 16481}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers', 'name': 'creative writers', 'id': 47285}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writers-group', 'name': 'Creative Writers Group', 'id': 66872}, {'urlkey': 'creative-writing-group', 'name': 'Creative Writing Group', 'id': 1081732}]",Zurich-and-Thalwil-Writing-Group,3600000,public,Writers

Impress us with observations that are uniquely yours. Pull us into the moment when it all goes down. Conclude as a different person: Victorious? Defeated? Bewildered? Enlightened? …<b>CHANGED</b>.</i></p>
<p>FORMAT (can vary month to month)<br><span>18:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Drinks and networking&nbsp;<br></span><span>18:30&nbsp; &nbsp;Guest storyteller(s), group exercises and discussion&nbsp;<br></span><span>20:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Member storytelling and group feedback<br></span><span>21:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Good byes &amp; networking</span></p>

On est souvent bien dans seul face au changement, ce qui rend difficile de respecter ses engagements personnels et qui finit par nous faire laisser tomber... <br>L'idée ici est donc de trouver des personnes dans la même situation pour se motiver les uns les autres et pour que chacun atteignent ses objectifs! On est toujours plus efficace quand on sait que quelque part, quelqu'un compte sur nous pour y arriver! <br>J'aimerais également en profiter pour partager mon expérience en tant que Coach en Développement Personnel et vous faire découvrir certaines clés, certaines méthodes pour vous aider à <i>Simplifier votre vie!</i></p>

<p>The purpose of this group is to bring together people from all walks of life, sharing a desire or a need for change in their lives, and a strong willingness to get take action and get started! We often feel alone in the face of change, which makes it difficult to respect our personal commitments and we end up giving up on our goals... <br>The idea here is to find people in a similar situation to motivate each other and to ensure everyone reaches their goals! We are always more efficient when we know that somewhere, someone is counting on us to succeed! <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience as a Lifestyle Coach and help you discover some tools and methods that will allow you to&nbsp;<i>Redesign your life!</i></p>",https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/highres_468292121.jpeg,468292121.0,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/600_468292121.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/9/thumb_468292121.jpeg,event,26694769,open,46.209999084472656,https://www.meetup.com/Redesign_Your_Life/,6.139999866485596,50,REDESIGN YOUR LIFE,246607522,Martin Perrier,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/highres_274473591.jpeg,274473591,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/member_274473591.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/3/3/7/thumb_274473591.jpeg,member,0.0,Europe/Zurich,"[{'urlkey': 'bookclub', 'name': 'Book Club', 'id': 2767}, {'urlkey': 'consciousness', 'name': 'Consciousness', 'id': 4417}, {'urlkey': 'conversation', 'name': 'Conversation', 'id': 15099}, {'urlkey': 'writing', 'name': 'Writing', 'id': 16728}, {'urlkey': 'self-exploration', 'name': 'Self Exploration', 'id': 29158}]",Redesign_Your_Life,3600000,public,Membres
